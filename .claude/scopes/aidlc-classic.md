# classic scope

`classic` is the implicit default scope - used when neither the user nor
`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` names one - and restores v1-style ceremony through
Inception and Construction, with one human approval per stage. Ideation is
skipped and Operation remains a placeholder. Stage-declared execution modes
are unchanged; collaborators are off, so each stage runs with its lead agent
only (`/aidlc --collaborators on` brings the support agents in).

Guard Policy defaults to off: changed inputs are recorded and announced in one line, and plan approval, review freeze, state transition, and reviewer read scope are lowered for undirected work. Human presence stays up.

Reviews are advisory: one pass per stage whose findings reach the human at
the approval gate, with no refute-and-repair loop; explicit autonomy keeps the
single pre-merge review. Walking-skeleton ceremony and summary confirmation
are off. Sensors run and the learnings ritual runs. Under off, Plan Approval,
review freeze, state transition, and reviewer read scope stand aside for
undirected work and record a `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` row each time; the approval
question is still asked by the conductor. Human-turn authority and audit remain
in force.

Override ceremonies per intent with `/aidlc --sensors on|off`,
`/aidlc --learnings on|off`, `/aidlc --summary-confirmation on|off`, and
`/aidlc --collaborators on|off`. The global kill switches
`AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1`, `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS=1`,
`AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION=1`, and `AIDLC_DISABLE_COLLABORATORS=1`
force their ceremony off even when the intent says on; they can also be
recorded with `aidlc config flags --bypass <NAME>`.

## Why these stages, why skip those

AI-DLC v1 had no Ideation phase, so `classic` skips all seven Ideation stages.
It keeps all Inception stages and the Construction stages through Build and
Test. CI Pipeline and all seven Operation stages are skipped: customers bring
their own CI and downstream, and Build and Test is the one integrated build
across every unit. Only eight stages are unconditional: the three Initialization stages,
Requirements Analysis, Units Generation, Delivery Planning, Code Generation,
and Build and Test. The remaining Inception and Construction work is
CONDITIONAL and self-selects from project context, preserving v1's adaptive behavior.

Its test strategy inherits Standard from its depth, so production testing
expectations remain in force. The separate `workshop` scope retains the
teaching-oriented Minimal test override for existing workshop workflows.

## Membership

Initialization, every Inception stage, and the Construction stages through
Build and Test are in the grid: 18 of 33 stages. All seven Ideation stages,
CI Pipeline, and all seven Operation stages are SKIP. The scope intentionally has no keywords; name it explicitly
or use the implicit default.
