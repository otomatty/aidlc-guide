# poc scope

Minimal depth aimed at proving feasibility fast. Almost everything except
the bare path to running code is skipped: capture the intent, reverse-
engineer any existing code, pull the requirements, then generate and test.
No design ceremony, no operations, no delivery planning.

Guard Policy defaults to off: changed inputs are recorded and announced, the spike keeps moving, and plan approval, review freeze, state transition, and reviewer read scope are lowered for undirected work. Human presence stays up.

Plan approval is off: once the code plan is written you see one line naming it,
code generation starts, and the line asks whether you want to look at the plan
first. You can also ask to see a plan before it is built, or to be asked about
every plan.

## Why these stages, why skip those

A proof of concept answers one question — "can this work?" — so it keeps
only the stages that get to an answer: intent-capture, reverse-engineering,
requirements-analysis, code-generation, build-and-test. The whole point is
to discard the rest (domain-design, units-generation, nfr work, the
operation phase) because a spike is throwaway. If the answer is yes,
re-scope to `feature`/`mvp` and run the full arc on the real build.

## Membership

Keyword triggers: `proof of concept`, `prototype`, `poc`, `spike`.
Initialization plus the thin feasibility path execute; everything else is
SKIP.
