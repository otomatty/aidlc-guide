# AI-DLC — express scope

Drive the AI-DLC engine with the **express** scope fixed. This is the same
deterministic forwarding loop the `/aidlc` orchestrator runs, with `--scope
express` baked into the first `next` so scope detection is skipped. The
engine owns all routing; the conductor persona arrives in the `conductor_persona`
field of the first `run-stage`, or of the first rules part when it is sent
ahead of that run-stage. Adopt it for the whole run.

## The loop

1. `directive = bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --scope express $ARGUMENTS`
2. Before acting on each directive, read
   `.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md` once per session,
   then read every
   `.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-<module>.md` named by
   `directive.protocol_modules`. Load every listed module before acting; skip
   only a module already loaded earlier in this session. Then act on
   `directive.kind` exactly as the orchestrator does (load-steering / run-stage /
   invoke-swarm / ask / print / error / done). A `load-steering` directive
   brings a stage's rules in parts ahead of its `run-stage` (most stages on
   GitHub Copilot): apply `directive.rules_content` in array order and keep it
   as that stage's rules, adopt `conductor_persona` when the part carries it,
   then run `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts continue <directive.receipt>`
   (copy the 8-character receipt printed at the top of the directive, never
   rebuild it) and act on the directive it returns. Never `report` a part or
   tell the user about it. Every engine `ask` carries `ask_type` and
   `response_route`: `next` follows the chosen command, `command` runs
   `resume_command` only when the human chooses to resume and then re-runs
   `next` (otherwise it waits for their direction), `claim` follows the Unit claim
   contract, and `execute-remedy` offers only executable guard remedies and
   executes the human-selected command or action. An empty remedy list is
   terminal; wait for the human and invent no report, receipt, reset, or decision.
   For `intent-pick`, choose the `select_commands` entry by its exact
   `selector` and execute its complete `command` verbatim, never by selector
   interpolation. Scope and compose commands retain `--request <8hex id>`;
   never append the request text. The ask names the request only by id (a
   pasted `<document>` block stays in the question store as data),
   while `question` echoes at most 240 characters, ending in `...`. The engine
   carries the request through a second `new-work-routing` ask (a question of
   its own) on any harness and through compose/creation handoffs until creation
   succeeds; a repeated answer carries on with the work it started instead of
   creating it twice.
   That ask carries its routes as `new_intent_command`, `scope_commands`,
   `compose_command`, and `continue_command` for the active workflow or (with
   `available_intents`) `select_commands` and `reshape_commands`; run the chosen one verbatim and
   preserve its description and scope; an unselected intent with new work waiting
   is not an `intent-pick`.
   Legacy Plan Approval recovery keeps its explicit bare-`next` choice.
   Never use `report` as a fallback for an engine ask answer; a selected guard
   remedy may still explicitly name a stage report.
3. `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <directive.stage> --result <outcome> [--user-input "<text>"]` only after acting on a stage directive. A redo, jump, or start-fresh request on re-entry is the sole non-stage report round-trip and uses `report --result resumed --choice <redo|jump|fresh>`.
4. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` only to the first `next` in step 1: every later pass runs
   bare `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next`, with no `--scope` and no
   `$ARGUMENTS` (repeating them would redo a jump or a setting the person
   already asked for). Keep going until `directive.kind == done`. A `done`
   without `directive.workflow_continues` is the real end: present the
   completion summary and stop. A `done` that carries it only recorded a step:
   run that bare `next` at once and act on what it returns, with no completion
   summary. If the person's reply that led to that step also asked to stop the
   workflow there for now (not to pause on one decision inside the work), run
   `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts park` instead and act on its
   `parked` directive.

On that first `next`, pass `$ARGUMENTS` through verbatim after `--scope express`; the engine parses
any flags (`--status`, `--stage`, …) and the `--scope` from the
state file always wins on an existing workflow, so re-running a started workflow
resumes it. To run a different scope, use `/aidlc --scope <other>` instead.

## Starting unrelated new work?

Before you forward `$ARGUMENTS` on step 1, make the SAME recognise-vs-route
judgment the `/aidlc` orchestrator makes: does this input **continue** the
active intent, or does it describe a **genuinely new, unrelated** piece of work?
This matters most when the active intent is already **complete**: then `next`
correctly returns `done` (the engine never creates alongside a live intent
without the confirmed new-work route), and the loop above would simply stop. New work is NOT a
continuation; the escape hatch is `next --new-intent`.

This recognition and conductor-authored offer apply only before an engine ask
is emitted. Once an ask exists, follow its typed route and supplied commands,
preserving any `--request` id rather than rebuilding the request.

- **Default to CONTINUATION.** Treat the input as new-work ONLY when it clearly
  names a distinct feature/bug/unit unrelated to the active intent's subject
  (`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine intent list --json` gives its `slug` and
  `status`). When in doubt, continue: false-positive offers are the main risk.
- **On genuine new-work, OFFER, never auto-create.** Surface an
  `AskUserQuestion` showing the active intent and the proposed new one, **including
  the scope you'd give the new intent**. Default that scope to this runner's baked
  `express` (the new work is likely the same flavour that made the user reach for
  this command), but if the new work clearly fits a DIFFERENT scope, propose that
  instead, and name it so the human can correct it. **Lead the affirmative option
  with "Yes"** (e.g. "Yes, start a second intent"). Never create it without
  their explicit yes.
- **On CONFIRM**, re-run `next` with `--new-intent`, the confirmed scope, and the
  new-work text:

  ```bash
  bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine orchestrate next --new-intent --scope <the confirmed scope> "<the new-work description>"
  ```

  The engine returns a `print` directive naming the `intent-create` command
  (with the `--label "<2-3 word kebab essence>"` placeholder). Act on it exactly
  as the loop's `print` handling describes: create the intent, then re-run
  `next` and carry on into the new work's first stage in this chat. Say the
  narration's line about starting it in a clean chat once: it is an option for
  the person, never a stop.
- **On DECLINE**, proceed with the active intent, the normal loop above.
