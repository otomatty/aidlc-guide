// Directive schema — the frozen engine↔conductor interface. The engine
// (aidlc-orchestrate.ts) answers "what's next?" with exactly one typed
// `Directive`; the conductor reads its `kind` and does the one move it names.
// This module defines the discriminated union over the 11 kinds the engine can
// emit, plus a runtime validator. Sibling of aidlc-stage-schema.ts and
// aidlc-sensor-schema.ts — same tool-boundary discipline: a refused or
// malformed directive is a clear signal, not a silent miss.
//
// Pure contract: no emit, no consume, reads/writes NO state, no I/O. The engine
// constructs directives and validates them before printing; the conductor
// parses and validates them on receipt. This file is the single shared
// definition both sides import, so the wire shape cannot drift between them.
//
// A directive names a `kind` and carries EXACTLY the fields that kind needs.
// `validateDirective` mirrors aidlc-stage-schema.ts: a ValidationResult union,
// per-field presence/type checks collected into an errors[] array, and
// unknown-key rejection per kind. The shape guard reuses isPlainObject from
// aidlc-lib.ts.

// knowledge: the first Construction Bolt's gate depends on the walking-skeleton
// STANCE, which an LLM resolves by reading a team's free-form `## Walking
// Skeleton` practices prose (no parser turns free English into a stance). The
// engine cannot decide it without smuggling an LLM into routing, so it DEFERS:
// it emits `gate: "unresolved"` for that one stage, the conductor classifies
// the prose and feeds the stance back via `aidlc-orchestrate report
// --skeleton-stance`, and the NEXT `next` emits the now-determined boolean gate.
// The engine still owns the transition — only a typed stance ever crosses back

// WHY THE ENGINE AUTHORS IT: the engine already knows, deterministically, which
// stage this is, what scope resolved, what it just decided, and what comes
// next. The conductor does not need to infer any of that to describe it, and
// when it does infer it, it describes the mechanism it can see (the tool call,
// the directive kind, the routing) rather than the user's project. Authoring the
// sentence where the facts live makes the spoken line deterministic too, and
// leaves the conductor a relay instead of an improviser - the same move the
// framework already made for rule delivery, where prose compliance failed and
// deterministic injection replaced it.
//
// This field is legal on EVERY kind (see NARRATION_FIELD in the allowed-key
// sets) so a new emission point can carry a line without a schema change. Keep
