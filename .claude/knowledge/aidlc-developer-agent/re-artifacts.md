# Reverse Engineering Artifact Templates

## Output Structure

All RE artifacts are created under `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` — the durable per-repo code knowledge base shared across intents (the space-level directory the `codekb-path --repo <repo>` tool resolves).

### Required Artifacts

1. **business-overview.md** — Business domain context, purpose, key functionality
2. **architecture.md** — System architecture, patterns, component relationships, Mermaid diagrams
3. **code-structure.md** — Package/module organization, file classification, code patterns
4. **api-documentation.md** — External and internal API surfaces, endpoints, contracts
5. **component-inventory.md** — Complete component list with responsibilities and dependencies
6. **technology-stack.md** — Languages, frameworks, libraries with versions
7. **dependencies.md** — External dependencies, internal cross-package dependencies
8. **code-quality-assessment.md** — Test coverage, linting, CI/CD, documentation quality, tech debt
9. **reverse-engineering-timestamp.md** - Records when reverse engineering was performed (date, commit hash if available) in a Run Record section, plus the structured Scope of Analysis block (templates below). The scope block is machine-read by `codekb-scope-diff` on the next rerun, so its accuracy decides whether a future intent can reuse the verified coverage or must merge/replace it.

### Developer Code Scan Template

```markdown
## Developer Code Scan Results

### Scan Coverage
- **Analyzed deeply**: [repo-relative dirs/files actually read and understood, one per line]
- **Skimmed only**: [areas noted at directory granularity without deep reading]
- **Left out**: [folders not opened because "What to Skip" in code-analysis-guide.md skips them, such as build output, one per line]

### Packages Found
- [package name] — [type] — [language] — [purpose]

### Build System
- **Type**: [build system]
- **Config Files**: [list]
- **Build Dependencies**: [package → package relationships]

### APIs Discovered
- [API type] — [location] — [endpoints/methods count]

### Frameworks & Libraries
- [name] — [version] — [purpose]

### Test Coverage
- **Test Directories**: [list]
- **Test Frameworks**: [list]
- **Coverage Config**: [present/absent]

### Code Quality Indicators
- **Linting**: [tool and config location]
- **CI/CD**: [pipeline files found]
- **Documentation**: [README presence, doc comments quality]

### Technical Debt Signals
- [signal description and location]

## Handoff Summary
- **Intent-relevant finding**: [the finding most relevant to the active intent, with file/line evidence]
- **Risks / follow-up**: [facts the architect or next stage must preserve; "None" if absent]
```

### Architecture Synthesis Template

```markdown
## Architecture Analysis

### System Overview
[High-level description of the system]

### Architectural Style
[Monolithic / Microservices / Serverless / Hybrid — with evidence]

### Component Relationships
[Mermaid diagram showing component interactions]

### Data Flow
[How data moves through the system]

### Key Design Decisions
[Notable architectural choices and their implications]

### Improvement Opportunities
[Areas where the architecture could be strengthened]

## Interaction Diagrams
[Mermaid sequence or flow diagrams showing how key business transactions are implemented across components]
```

AI-DLC ships no Mermaid validator, so there is none to look for: check each
diagram by reading it, keep to `flowchart` and `sequenceDiagram` syntax, and put
the text fallback beneath it.

### Run Record (reverse-engineering-timestamp.md)

Start reverse-engineering-timestamp.md with this section, so a reader sees
when the scan ran and against which commit before the Scope of Analysis block
below:

```markdown
# Reverse Engineering Timestamp

## Run Record

- Date: [ISO-8601 date of this run]
- Commit: [HEAD commit hash, or "unknown" when not available]
```

### Scope of Analysis Block (reverse-engineering-timestamp.md)

End reverse-engineering-timestamp.md with exactly this fenced block, filled
honestly from the Scan Coverage the developer reported - record what the run
ACTUALLY covered deeply, not what the stage aspired to cover:

````markdown
## Scope of Analysis

```yaml
scope_version: 1
kind: partial
intent: [active intent slug]
fingerprint: [output of the mint command below - verbatim; it prints "unknown" when not computable]
analyzed:
  paths:
    - [repo-relative dir (trailing slash) or file analyzed deeply, one per line]
  components:
    - [component names exactly as they appear in component-inventory.md]
shallow:
  paths:
    - [areas only skimmed]
```
````

How the tools read this block (everything you need to fill it):

- Mint the `fingerprint:` line with
  `bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine workspace codekb-scope-diff --repo <repo> --mint --paths <analyzed.paths, comma-separated>`
  (omit `--repo` only for an unrecorded project-root repo) and paste its
  output verbatim.
- The fingerprint covers the files under `analyzed.paths` as they are on disk,
  committed or not. It leaves out ignored files, .NET `bin/`, `obj/` and `out/`
  beside a project file, and, when the repository is the workspace root,
  AI-DLC's own workspace, install and settings. So `./` is right for a full
  scan that left build output unopened.
- `shallow.paths` is a record for people; no tool hashes or compares it. The
  next run's coverage compare reads `analyzed.paths` and `components`. A list
  with nothing in it is written `paths: []`.
- `intent:` is shown back by the tools and checked by none; write the
  intent's `slug` from `intents.json`.
- Publishing checks that the staging directory holds exactly the nine files,
  that this block parses under the rules below, that the snapshot paths cover
  `analyzed.paths`, and that `fingerprint:` equals a fresh mint over
  `analyzed.paths`. It does not read the Run Record.
- Check the finished block, in the staged
  `reverse-engineering-timestamp.md`, with
  `bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine workspace codekb-scope-diff --repo <repo> --check <that file>`
  (same `--repo` rule as the mint). It prints `VALID`, what it read, and
  whether the fingerprint matches the source now, or `INVALID` and what to
  fix. That is the parser publication uses.

Rules:
- `kind: full` only when the scan genuinely covered the whole repo deeply; `analyzed.paths` MUST include the repo root (`./`). Anything less is `kind: partial`.
- `kind: partial` MUST NOT include `./` in `analyzed.paths`.
- `analyzed.paths` entries are repo-relative, directories end with `/`, no glob characters.
- Component names must match `component-inventory.md` headings verbatim - the rerun guard compares them literally.
- A folder the scan left out (the developer's **Left out** list, such as build output) does not go in `shallow.paths`: it stays out of the block.
- A full rescan wholesale replaces all 9 artifacts and builds this block only from the new run.
- For a focused scan of an existing store, read all 9 existing artifacts and the prior Scope of Analysis block first. Update or extend prose for the newly analyzed area and preserve prior prose outside it.
- With a CURRENT store, merge `analyzed.paths` and `analyzed.components` as the union of the store and this run. A CURRENT `kind: full` store remains full and retains `./`; otherwise the merged block is partial and cannot claim `./`.
- With a STALE or UNVERIFIED store, record only this run in `analyzed.paths` and `analyzed.components`, preserve the prior prose, and demote the store's prior analyzed paths into `shallow.paths`.
- With an UNKNOWN_SCOPE legacy store, merge the prior prose best-effort but record only this run in the new scope block.
- Mint `fingerprint` over the final `analyzed.paths` in the merged or replaced block.
- Build all 9 candidate artifacts under the temporary `<record>/.aidlc-engine/codekb-stage-<repo>/` directory. Never write a cumulative merge directly into the shared CodeKB.
- The pre-scan `codekb-snapshot` paths bound verified coverage. If the scan discovers a deep path outside that set, take a new snapshot and repeat the scan over the expanded set.
- Publish only through `codekb-publish` with the snapshot's store generation and source fingerprint. A store-generation conflict requires re-reading and re-merging the winner's store; a source conflict requires a fresh scan.
