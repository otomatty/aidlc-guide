// PostToolUse hook (Bash matcher): Dispatch `aidlc-runtime.ts compile`
// after every transition-class audit emit.
//
// Fires after every Bash tool call from the agent. Filters cheaply on
// the command — only direct transition tools plus `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report`
// get past the early exit. On match, tail-reads the LAST 3
// audit blocks (one approve writes up to 3 audit rows in a single Bash
// call), regex-matches `**Event**: (GATE_APPROVED|STAGE_STARTED|
// AUDIT_MERGED|WORKFLOW_COMPLETED)` against any of them, and dispatches
// `aidlc-runtime.ts compile` on match.
//
// WORKFLOW_COMPLETED is in the transition set so the final-stage approve
// fires the compile (handleCompleteWorkflow at aidlc-state.ts:572-590
// emits 5 audit rows ending with WORKFLOW_COMPLETED — without it in the
// regex, the last 3 blocks would be PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED +
// WORKFLOW_COMPLETED, none in the original transition set, and the
// runtime-graph would never record the final stage as approved).
//
// Recursion guard: `aidlc-runtime.ts` is excluded from the command-regex
// matcher set, AND MEMORY_EMPTY is not in the event-class regex. The
// compile's own audit emits cannot re-trigger the compile.
//
// Engine error relay: before the command filter, when this Bash call was one
// literal framework engine orchestrate invocation whose stdout is exactly the
// canonical `error` directive the engine emitted, the message is handed to the
// human byte for byte through the harness's hook-to-human channel (a
// `systemMessage` on Claude Code and Codex, a toast via the opencode plugin).
// The same line carries a PostToolUse `additionalContext` note telling the
// model the person has seen it; the Claude and Codex skills then add no copy
// of their own. It needs no workflow state: the engine errors before any
// intent exists too.
