 * The equivalence guarantee for the two guardPath copies
 * (nfr-design/security-design.md S-DB-2).
 *
 * docs-bridge duplicates reader-core's containment algorithm rather than
 * depending on the package (which would pull chokidar into its install
 * closure). This one table is run against BOTH implementations — from
 * `packages/docs-bridge/tests/guard-path-vectors.test.ts` and from
 * `packages/reader-core/tests/guard-path-vectors.test.ts` — so drift between
 * the copies fails a test rather than silently weakening one boundary.
 *
 * reader-core's own `guard-path.test.ts` stays as-is; this suite is additive.
