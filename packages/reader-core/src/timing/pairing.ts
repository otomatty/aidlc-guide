 * same sorted array instead of re-deriving its own sweep-line (which would
 * silently reintroduce pairing logic into attribution).
 *
 * Risk note 2: boundaries include runs that are ultimately NOT reported —
 * `abandoned` (a double-START's first attempt) and `skipped` (a
 * STAGE_SKIPPED-while-active run). In the single-loop original these sat in
 * `openRuns` while open: they soaked up attributed events and advanced
 * cursors, and only then vanished. Omitting them here would let pass 2
 * attribute their events to a different (wrong) run. `disposition` lets
 * final assembly report only `completed`/`recovered-completed`/`open` while
 * attribution still sees all six kinds.
 *
 * Risk note 3: "most recently opened" is insertion order of STAGE_STARTED
 * events in this sorted stream, including the delete-then-reinsert a
 * same-stage double-start performs. Pass 2 walking `events` by index and
 * opening/closing boundaries at their recorded indices reproduces that
