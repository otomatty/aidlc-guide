 *
 * The engine enters its unit-major walk only when `Construction Iteration` is
 * exactly `unit-major` and the plan runs `units-generation`
 * (aidlc-orchestrate.ts `emitForSlug` → `emitUnitMajorRunStage`, which falls
 * back to the stage-by-stage walk under aidlc-lib.ts
 * `usesStageLevelPerUnitArtifacts`). The plan action is the row's
 * EXECUTE/SKIP suffix, whatever its checkbox says. A state file without a
 * `units-generation` row reads as not running it: the engine would consult
 * the scope file, which this reader does not load.
