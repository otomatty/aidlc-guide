/**
 * L3 — where the next human approval gate falls, and how much estimated work
 * is left before it opens. Pure: no filesystem, no clock.
 *
 * It walks the reconciled views forward from the current stage and sums their
 * {@link StageView.remainingMs} until the first stage whose completion the
 * engine presents to a human. Like `estimateRemaining`, it adds no arithmetic
 * of its own that a stage row could disagree with.
 *
 * Gate placement mirrors the engine at stage granularity, citing the engine's
 * own predicates so an engine update has one place to be checked against:
 *
 *  - Initialization stages proceed without approval; every other in-scope
 *    stage presents a gate (aidlc-orchestrate.ts `computeGate`,
 *    stage-protocol.md §1).
 *  - Construction completion gates follow aidlc-lib.ts
 *    `isAutonomousConstructionGate` and the unit-major walk in
 *    aidlc-orchestrate.ts `emitUnitMajorRunStage` ({@link placementOf}).
 *  - The walking skeleton's checkpoint always needs a person
 *    (aidlc-construction-checkpoints.ts `humanRequired`); the audit log says
 *    whether it has been passed ({@link skeletonCheckpointCleared}).
 *
 * The views carry no per-Unit progress: which Unit is current, how many are
 * left, whether a checkpoint was verified. A per-Unit approval is therefore
 * reported as `unit`, whose stage-level sum covers every Unit still to come.
 * Plan Approval inside Code Generation is flagged, never used as a delimiter.
