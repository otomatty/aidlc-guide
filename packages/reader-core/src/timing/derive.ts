/**
 * L3 — stage run derivation. Pure: no filesystem, no clock. `now` is injected
 * so an open run measures deterministically under test.
 *
 * Nothing is recorded to produce this. The audit log already holds every
 * STAGE_STARTED/STAGE_COMPLETED pair; this only pairs them up.
 *
 * Composition only, split (issue #5) out of a single 544-line file that used
 * to interleave two concerns in one event loop: PAIRING (which events
 * open/close/discard a run, under cross-shard clock skew, reruns, single-
 * stage isolation — `./pairing.ts`) and ATTRIBUTION (which open run accrues
 * each interval of time, under concurrent unit-major runs and silent tails —
 * `./attribution.ts`). Across ~15 external-review rounds a fix to one
 * concern kept breaking the other; each is now independently testable. This
 * file's own job is just: run pairing, run attribution over its output,
 * merge warnings, assemble `StageTiming[]` in the order the original
 * single-loop would have pushed them.
