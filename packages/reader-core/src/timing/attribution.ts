/**
 * L3 — time attribution (pass 2 of 2). Pure aside from the injected `now`:
 * no filesystem, no clock read of its own. Given pass 1's (`./pairing.ts`)
 * sorted event stream and run boundaries, decides which open run accrues
 * each interval of wall time, under concurrent unit-major runs, silent
 * tails, and pre-start events. Knows nothing about *pairing* decisions — it
 * never opens, closes, abandons or discards a run; it only walks the
 * boundaries pass 1 already decided and bills time against them.
 *
 * FORM (issue #8): a TIMELINE PARTITION, not per-run cursors.
 *
 * This file used to give every open run its own cursor (`prevMs`) and add an
 * increment to it per event. In that shape `Σ activeMs <= wall time` was an
 * invariant maintained by DISCIPLINE — every code path had to remember that a
 * span already billed to one run must not also reach another — and review
 * broke it six times running (PR #4 rounds R7, R9, R10, R14 and two more):
 * a gap billed to two runs at once, a tail billed to every open run, an
 * event landing before its own stage started, a tail whose owner never moved
 * when work did. Each fix closed one variant and left the shape that
 * generated them intact.
 *
 * The shape here cannot express those bugs. The span between two adjacent
 * instants — two adjacent events, or the last event and `now` — is a SLICE,
 * and the timeline is exactly the ordered list of its slices: they tile
 * `[first event, now]` end to end, no gaps, no overlaps. Each slice is
 * capped at `IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS` and handed to AT MOST ONE owner
 * (`sliceOwner` below), then folded. No run holds a cursor, so no run can
 * reach back over a span someone else was already given; time that belongs
 * to nobody is dropped rather than shared out.
 *
 * What is left is one question — "who owns this slice?" — answered by one
 * pure function over plain data. The six historical bugs all collapse into
 * that single decision, so that is where the exhaustive tests point
 * (`tests/timing-slice-owner.test.ts`). A wrong answer there misdelivers a
 * slice; it can no longer make wall time appear or vanish.
 */

/**
 * Gaps longer than this are treated as the human being away.
 *
 * ponytail: each slice is CAPPED at this value rather than dropped. A stage
 * that spends 26 minutes on one silent generation emits few audit events;
 * dropping over-threshold slices would report it as ~1 minute and erase the
 * very number this feature exists to show. Capping bounds the error at one
 * threshold per slice in both directions. Tune if stages start emitting
 * events on a different cadence.
 *
 * `pairing.ts` also imports this to bound its clock-skew recovery window —
 * a different use of the same "a gap this large means something else is
 * going on" number, not a second definition of it.

 * in the audit log — everything else (ARTIFACT_CREATED, sensor events, ...)
 * is written with `stage: null`. So "credit an event to every open run when
 * it names no stage" would, in practice, credit *every* concurrently-open
 * design stage with *all* of the block's wall time. The rules, in the order
 * they are applied:
 *
 * 1. STAGE_COMPLETED owns the slice for the run it closes, and only that run
 *    — never the most recently opened one, even when it closes nothing (a
 *    completion whose own stage has no open run: the cross-shard skew case
 *    pairing.ts routes to `pendingTerminals`). A completion that names a
 *    stage is evidence of work on THAT stage; giving its slice to some other
 *    open run would double-count the span once the completion later recovers
 *    into its own (typically zero-duration) run via pairing's Part 2.
 * 2. STAGE_STARTED and STAGE_SKIPPED own nothing. A start marks work moving
 *    ONTO a brand-new run — the span before it belongs to whatever came
 *    before, and the new run cannot be billed for time that predates it
 *    (R14's other half). A skip's run is being discarded, not billed.
 * 3. An event that names a stage goes to that stage's open run, or to nobody
 *    if it has none (R10). stage-protocol.md (unit-major iteration) states a
 *    stage's own STAGE_STARTED can legally land AFTER that stage's per-Unit
 *    artifact events, so a stage-keyed event with no open run yet is
 *    expected, not an anomaly — and falling back to the most recently opened
 *    run for it would charge the slice to a DIFFERENT, earlier stage that is
 *    merely still open for its own late cascade gate, stealing both activeMs
 *    and eventCount from the stage that actually did the work.
 * 4. An event that names no stage (the common case) goes to the most recently
 *    opened run. That matches how unit-major actually executes: within a Unit
 *    the four design stages run one at a time in graph order even though
 *    earlier ones stay open pending their cascade gate, so whichever stage
 *    opened last is the one real work is currently landing against.
