 * says which came first. If the two sort sites disagreed
 * on which pairs of events tie, they could silently invert that ordering. Time
 * is compared numerically (`Date.parse`), never by string equality, so an
 * offset or millisecond timestamp form still ties correctly.
 *
 * `Date.parse` returns `NaN` for a malformed timestamp, and `NaN` comparisons
 * are always false — a comparator that returns `NaN` is not a total order,
 * and `Array.prototype.sort` is free to leave unrelated well-formed events
 * out of order around it (regression, finding 1: this used to compare
 * timestamp *strings*, which never produced `NaN`). Every malformed
 * timestamp is partitioned to a fixed position — after every well-formed one
 * — in *both* comparators, independent of direction, so it can never sit
 * between two well-formed events and corrupt their relative order. Ties
 * within that partition (two malformed events, or two equal well-formed
 * ones) still fall back to shard name and then recorded append position.
