/**
 * The one place `acquireVsCodeApi()` is ever called.
 *
 * VS Code allows it **once per webview** and throws
 * `An instance of the VS Code API has already been acquired` on every call
 * after the first. Three call sites had grown up independently — the transport
 * on boot, `openDocInIde`, and `openFileInIde` — so in a real webview the first
 * one won and the other two threw before they could post anything. Nothing
 * caught it, because a test stub is happy to be acquired twice.
 *
 * So this is a single enforcement point rather than a convention: there is one
 * function to call, and it hands back the same instance every time.
