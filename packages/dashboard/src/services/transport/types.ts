/**
 * How long a GET may stay outstanding before the transport gives up on it,
 * settles it as unreached, and releases whatever it was holding.
 *
 * Neither transport bounded a request before (Codex review on PR #18): a
 * `fetch` against a wedged connection has no timeout of its own, and the VS
 * Code transport resolves only when the extension host posts a matching
 * `get-response`, so a stranded host left the resolver in `pendingGet` for the
 * life of the webview. One user-initiated read stalling is a visible bug; the
 * dashboard's timings poll made it an accumulating one, since it asks again
 * every 30s whether or not the last answer ever came.
 *
 * 20s, deliberately under `App.tsx`'s `TIMINGS_POLL_MS`: every request the
 * poll issues is resolved — one way or the other — before the next one goes
 * out, so nothing piles up and the poll is single-flight in fact and not just
 * in shape. It is also far outside any real read: NFR-2 budgets 3s for the
 * whole first paint against the 593-file fixture, and `/api/timings` measures
 * ~90ms warm.
