# Construction Phase -- Stage Reference (3.1-3.7)

## Phase Overview

The Construction phase transforms design artifacts from Inception into working,
tested software. It covers seven stages (3.1 through 3.7) that span functional
design, non-functional requirements and design, infrastructure design, code
generation, build/test verification, and CI pipeline configuration.

Construction is the fourth of five phases in the AI-DLC methodology. The
compiled scope grid determines which stages execute and which are skipped.
Runtime Unit batches come from `unit-of-work-dependency.md` (stage 2.7).
Delivery Planning (Stage 2.9) produces the approved Bolt plan — planning
content, not the walk source.

All stages follow `stage-protocol.md` for approval gates, question format,
completion messages, and state tracking.

> **Path convention.** Each workflow's artifacts live under its **intent record
> dir** — `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (where `<space>` is
> `default` unless a non-default space is in play, and `<YYMMDD>-<label>` is the
> intent directory: a compact UTC date prefix like `260624` plus a short
> kebab-case label so records sort chronologically). Below, `<record>/` is
> shorthand for that dir; e.g.
> `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` expands to
> `aidlc/spaces/default/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/`.
> The dir name is a human-readable label; the canonical identity is the UUIDv7
> stored in the `intents.json` registry row. (Projects created before the
> per-intent layout used a flat tree; the engine migrates them on first run.)

## Construction walk

A [Bolt](../../guide/glossary.md) is the planned delivery slice recorded in
Delivery Planning: one or more Units with a Definition of Done, confidence
hypothesis, and ownership. Runtime order follows `unit-of-work-dependency.md`
and the recorded iteration choice, not the grouping in `bolt-plan.md`.

New solo workflows that include Unit decomposition and an in-scope
source-producing per-unit stage default to `Construction Checkpoints: enabled`,
`Construction Iteration: unit-major`, and `Construction Execution: serial`.
They complete one Unit's applicable design and source-producing stages before
the next. Preserve an explicit stage-major choice. Design-only and no-Unit
workflows retain their existing stage flow; team-owned work uses `unit_gate`.
Existing workflows without the checkpoint setting keep the legacy first-stage
review and late per-stage gate cascade.

For eligible checkpoint work with skeleton-on, the first DAG Unit is the
smallest working integrated slice. It completes its applicable stages, including
Code Generation, before later Units even with stage-major selected. Its real
end-to-end project check must pass, and a human must approve that verified
skeleton. A legacy first Construction-stage approval is only a stage review;
it does not establish that an integrated skeleton has been built.

All Unit/batch checkpoints reuse the intent's recorded, human-authorized
`Construction Verification Command`. Delivery Planning proposes it from the
project scan. Before presenting the command, write it to
`<record>/verification-command.txt` with the harness's file-write tool
(Write/edit), never a shell `echo` or heredoc. Repo-derived command text must never
be interpolated into a shell line, where substitutions could execute before
approval. Use the invoking SessionStart session ID: both `log decision` and
`log answer` require
`--checkpoint verification-command --command-file verification-command.txt --session "<session ID>"`.
Copy the complete canonical command exactly from the `command` field in the
`decision` tool's JSON output into the verification-command question's code span;
never abbreviate it. Choose a delimiter that preserves any command backticks.
The human can also open `<record>/verification-command.txt`. The canonical
command is a nonblank single line of at most 1024 characters. Control characters
and display-spoofing characters (Unicode format characters, including zero-width
and bidi controls, line/paragraph separators, and no-break space U+00A0) are refused.
The human's exact **Approve** / **Request Changes** reply in that session binds
the answer to the pending command. Only **Approve** authorizes the receipt;
an unrelated reply, **Request Changes**, or a reply from another session does not.
Never write `--details "Approve"` unless the human chose it; only then run
`state set-construction-verification-command --command-file verification-command.txt` to write the matching Runtime
State field. A human may defer when no runnable
check exists yet; the first checkpoint then asks. The current approval receipt,
not the field alone, authorizes execution. Changing it requires a new receipt
and typed setter, never generic `state set` or an automatic choice.

Skeleton-off offers **Continue automatically** / **Review each checkpoint** at
Construction entry; skeleton-on offers it after the real skeleton checkpoint.
Only an emitted offer with no recorded choice prompts automatically. On-demand
requests can change the choice during Construction. The answer controls ordinary
completion questions; it never grants Plan Approval, verification command
selection, an enabled summary confirmation, or successful verification of a
failed check.

```text
Eligible new source-producing solo Unit workflow:
  Default: unit-major + serial + verified Unit checkpoints
  Skeleton-on: first whole integrated Unit → real check → human approval
  When offered: Continue automatically / Review each checkpoint
  Remaining Units: applicable stages → checks → completion per recorded policy
  Completion-only stage directives: bookkeeping over recorded Unit approvals

Existing, design-only, no-Unit, or team-owned workflow:
  Preserve its recorded path and applicable stage or Unit-gate policy

After the per-unit work:
  Build and Test, then CI Pipeline if included, run once across the solution
```

**Route checkpoints before bodies.** A `construction_checkpoint` directive
verifies and approves existing Unit work; it does not rerun Code Generation.
With `command_authorized: false`, ask the verification-command question before
any `verify`, complete the human decision/answer/setter flow, then call `next`.
Show "Verified with `<full command>` (exit 0)" in the approval question;
`verification_command` is the full canonical recorded command, never an abbreviated label.
A `swarm_checkpoint` handles a completed batch before later batch work. After
verification, approval, or rejection, call `next`, never approve the whole stage for one Unit or batch.
Only after `verify` reports `verified: true` and the current checkpoint has
`ready: true`, open the human Unit/skeleton approval question with
`aidlc engine bolt checkpoint --action ask --unit "<unit>" --kind <unit|skeleton> --session "<session ID>"`;
`ask` refuses an unready or unverified checkpoint. For a human batch question,
only after status reports `ready: true`, run
`aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action ask --batch <N> --units "<Units>" --session "<session ID>"`.
Then present **Approve** / **Request Changes** and wait. The human's exact reply
in that session, to this checkpoint question, authorizes the matching action;
an unrelated reply, another session's reply, or a reply to a different question
does not. Pass that same `--session` on approval/rejection and never pass
`--user-input` the human did not choose. Consent is one-shot and bound to the
current checkpoint fingerprint, verification proof ID, and authorized command
digest (batch questions bind the fingerprint and per-Unit `Command SHA-256` set).
Re-running `verify` or swarm `finalize` withdraws every open checkpoint question
and captured checkpoint response for this intent, in any session. Re-verify,
confirm `verified: true` (batch: `ready: true` after source landing), and ask again;
an older response cannot approve the new evidence. Automatic approval
(`human_required: false`) needs no `ask` and no `--user-input`; human rejection
always needs this verified question-and-answer flow.

A stage with `construction_policy.completion_only: true` and
`human_completion_required: false` skips body, questions, reviewer, and learnings
prompt, then reports `awaiting-approval` and `approved` without invented user
input. Other completion gates follow `human_completion_required`; the legacy
path without policy retains its existing human-gate procedure.

Version-4 checkpoint proofs retain the command's `command_sha256` and full
canonical command in `command_label`, plus exit status, full stdout/stderr byte
counts and SHA-256 digests, and the last 2 KiB of each stream in `stdout_tail` and
`stderr_tail`. These tails also appear in checkpoint CLI JSON. They are decoded
as UTF-8 after dropping a leading partial multibyte sequence, with control
characters other than newline and tab replaced by U+FFFD; full output is not
retained. Project check commands must not print secrets: tails are not
secret-redacted. Use the tails to explain a failure; any further diagnostics use
the same authorized project check, not a newly chosen command. Legacy version-1
through version-3 proofs require re-verification with
`aidlc engine bolt checkpoint --action verify --unit "<unit>" --kind <unit|skeleton>`
before the Unit can be approved. `GATE_APPROVED` binds `Verification Command SHA-256`
to the proof's digest.
The verifier records a tool-owned `CHECKPOINT_VERIFICATION_RECORDED` receipt
alongside the proof file, and approval requires that receipt; a hand-written
proof file cannot verify a Unit.

Code Generation's Plan Approval remains a human stop before generation for every
Unit. Grouped Plan Approval may present the exact live swarm Unit set together,
but still records individual receipts. Pre-generation summary confirmation is
required only when `directive.ceremony.summary_confirmation === "on"`. See
[Construction commands](../../guide/12-cli-commands.md#construction-order-and-execution)
for the checkpoint and approval commands.

**Iteration and execution are separate.** Unit-major is serial. To choose swarm
explicitly for eligible checkpoint work, select stage-major and then
`Construction Execution: swarm`; guided and automatic completion are both
supported. An autonomy answer does not change execution or iteration order.
Already approved inline Units are not rebuilt by a later swarm. Legacy workflows
without the execution setting retain their existing autonomy-based swarm route.

**Team-owned gates.** With `Unit Ownership: team`, the `per-stage` rhythm gates
each settled `(stage, Unit)` before that Unit advances; `unit-end` gates once
after its final applicable per-unit stage. These remain separate from the solo
checkpoint policy. The engine refreshes `Unit Progress`, and each gate report
names its Unit so decisions and receipt floors remain scoped to that work.

Team-mode claims use `claim/<intent-id8>/<unit>` refs with compare-and-swap
updates. A successful claim writes a gitignored checkout stamp; that checkout
routes only the stamped Unit and carries the claim generation on lifecycle,
review, gate, and fork evidence. Unscoped main emits a terminal fan-out notice
while claims are live. `aidlc-unit.ts release <unit>` writes a tombstone instead
of deleting the ref, invalidating stale attempts while preserving history. A
participant clone opts into the guided claim picker once with
`aidlc-unit.ts participate`; facilitator main deliberately omits that marker.
Scoped routing and receipt writes are offline-first: the claim-time stamp is
authoritative. Registry liveness is rechecked only at claim-sensitive
boundaries such as fork/release; an unavailable remote warns and proceeds from
the stamp, while an online stale or released attempt is refused.

Completed teams commit and run `aidlc unit publish <unit>`. Unscoped main then
pins the exact claim-ref OID, validates its artifacts/receipts/gates/reviews and
Plan Approval without materializing a worktree, records one human merge gate,
and lands the candidate through `aidlc unit land`. Git content lands before the
Unit row is folded; main-owned state/runtime markers are retained, the team's
new audit shard transports its attempt-keyed receipts, and `UNIT_MERGED` marks
the row. Source conflicts abort before state mutation. After the final merged
row, Build and Test and CI Pipeline route once on main.

**Per-unit batch waves (optional, stage-major only).** On a recorded
stage-major path, the engine MAY emit `directive.wave` for one of the four
inline design stages (3.1–3.4). The wave comes from one healed DAG snapshot;
the conductor does not read `runtime-graph.json` or derive sibling paths.
Code Generation (3.5, `workspace_requires: true`) is NEVER wave-eligible:
concurrent builders would collide writing into the shared workspace (the
swarm path's per-unit worktrees exist for exactly this isolation), and its
initial Step 3 Plan Approval is a mandatory hard stop in every execution mode that
cannot fold into a builder's return message. The stop is the conductor's:
under a `relaxed` or `off` Guard Policy the plan-approval fence stands aside
for undirected work and records `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` instead of refusing.
After approval, content edits for the same target and attempt follow the
effective-fence rule in Code Generation below; a lowered fence permits
continuation without another Plan Approval stop.

Each entry carries kind-resolved consumes, explicit absent consumes, all
produces, the applicable required subset, a Unit-local diary path, build state,
paired-review state, and whether its wave completion receipt is still required.
Builders receive the parent stage file, inline context roster, warnings, and
exact accumulated steering content. A blocked builder withholds an applicable
required path, not an optional or kind-exempt path. After build and review,
`unit complete --wave` verifies the live entry, fans Unit diary entries into the
parent diary idempotently, and emits `UNIT_COMPLETED`. The engine holds the
current batch until every applicable Unit has all of that evidence, then permits
a dependent batch or the single stage gate. Waves never apply under
`Construction Iteration: unit-major`; harnesses without a parallel dispatch
primitive process the entries serially. See
`stage-protocol-construction.md` § "Per-unit batch waves" for the full contract.

**Parallel batches.** Follow the exact dependency-ready Units emitted by the
engine. Explicit stage-major/swarm execution can dispatch eligible Code
Generation Units concurrently. In checkpoint-enabled workflows, each completed
batch returns a `swarm_checkpoint` for guided or automatic completion before
later work. Legacy swarm settlement retains its existing stage gate.
`BOLT_STARTED` / `BOLT_COMPLETED` are per Unit/worktree on the swarm path;
`SWARM_COMPLETED` closes the batch. Serial inline work uses its Unit lifecycle
and checkpoint receipts.

Each new Bolt worktree is `.aidlc/worktrees/bolt-<id8>_<slug>` on branch
`bolt-<id8>_<slug>`. The intent registry UUID suffix `<id8>` is shared with
Unit claims, so parallel intents can reuse Unit slugs without sharing branches
or retained/parked refs. Creation refuses an intent without a registry UUID;
adopt or re-create the intent before Construction. See
[Bolt identity](../../../core/knowledge/aidlc-shared/worktree-info-schema.md#bolt-identity)
for naming and the provenance checks that let pre-upgrade legacy Bolts finish
without creating new Bolts in the old shape. Cleanup refuses a branch checked
out at another worktree path and preserves that owner's branch and refs.

Before initial protected prepare, all Units undergo a read-only preflight of
current approval or permitted postapproval continuation, plus committed,
reproducible parent application source. This
applies to legacy autonomy and new checkpoints. An uncommitted approved source
snapshot is refused before any child is created: obtain explicit authorization
to commit it, then retry. The inline skeleton's approved source must be committed
before a later parallel batch; prepare never makes that commit automatically.

A rejected batch with `resume_existing: true` uses `prepare --resume-existing`.
If rejection retired the prior approval, obtain fresh Plan Approval for the
revision. Retries after that approval may use lowered-fence continuation for
the same intent, target, and attempt: `execution_allowed: true` permits it even
with `ok: false`, without reviving an older attempt's approval.
Surviving worktrees retain source and archive prior
metadata. If native source landing removed a child, the tool can recreate it from
the already-landed parent source when the required landing evidence exists,
retaining the rejection revision. It does not promise preservation of every
post-merge child. See [Swarm prepare](../../guide/12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-engine-swarm-prepare-prepare-a-reproducible-batch).

**Failure handling.** A Code Generation failure always halts Construction
regardless of autonomy mode. Options are retry (re-run just the failed
Unit), skip (mark `[S]` and continue — dependents may also fail), or abort.
Successful siblings in a parallel batch keep their `[x]` status and
artifacts. See `stage-protocol-construction.md` §§ "Unit and skeleton checkpoints" and
"Halt-and-ask on failure" for the canonical procedures.
The ordinary failure-prompt Abort pauses Construction with the worktree
preserved. A stale-review recovery abort explicitly carrying `--discard` instead
parks tracked and non-ignored untracked files and reviewed source refs, then
removes the live checkout and branch. After obtaining the human's selection,
execute the returned abort command unchanged. When present, the abort result's
`restore_operation` has route `worktree` and exact args selecting the saved
slug, stamp, and repository (`--repo <name>` or `--repo .`), followed by
`--intent <record-dir-name> --space <space>` so recovery stays bound to that
intent after the active intent changes. On a human
restore request, invoke `{{INVOKE}} engine worktree <args...>` with each listed
arg passed exactly as a separate argv argument, never joined into a shell
command. Restoration recovers files in `.aidlc/restored/bolt-<id8>_<slug>-<stamp>` on
`restore/bolt-<id8>_<slug>-<stamp>`, without overwriting a new live Bolt or reviving the
old attempt's review authority. `restore_hint` is optional human display text
only, not execution input. If safe rendering fails, the hint is omitted and
`restore_hint_error` explains why while the operation remains. Offer restoration
based on the operation, not the hint. If only review evidence remained, the
`evidence-only` descriptor has no restoration operation, hint, hint error, or
exclusions: no working files were saved, restore refuses, and doctor offers
purge only.
The [recovery walkthrough](../../guide/15-troubleshooting.md#a-bolt-attempt-was-set-aside-getting-the-files-back)
explains what was set aside, the exclusions, exact restore selection, and
informational doctor listings and purge options. Legacy restores retain the
legacy name and require the selected intent's exact `WORKTREE_DISCARDED`
`Parked ref` provenance.

### Purpose

Design the business logic, domain model, and rules for a single unit of work.
The aidlc-architect-agent leads with the aidlc-developer-agent providing technical
feasibility input.

### Inputs

- Unit definition from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md`
- Assigned stories from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work-story-map.md`
- Requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- Domain design artifacts from `<record>/inception/domain-design/`

### Steps

1. **Read Unit Context** -- Read the unit definition, assigned stories,
   requirements, and domain design artifacts.

2. **Create Functional Design Plan** -- Analyze the unit's scope and create a
   questions file at
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/functional-design-questions.md`
   with context-appropriate questions using `[Answer]:` tags. Focus areas:
   - Business logic workflows and algorithms
   - Domain models and entity relationships
   - Business rules, constraints, and validation logic
   - Data flow and transformations
   - Integration points with other units or external systems
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Frontend components (component hierarchy, props/state, interaction flows,
     form validation)
   - Business scenarios (end-to-end user journeys, happy/unhappy paths,
     concurrency edge cases)

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md question flow (offer interaction mode choice, collect
   answers, write back to file). Perform MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   - Identify vague answers ("mix of", "not sure", "depends", "probably")
   - Check for contradictions between answers
   - Flag missing details needed for artifact generation
   - If ANY ambiguity found: create follow-up questions and resolve before
     proceeding

4. **Generate Artifacts** -- Generate the following in
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/`:
   - **functional-spec.md**: Detailed algorithms, workflows, data
     transformations, processing sequences, and decision trees for the unit's
     business logic
   - **rules.md**: Decision rules, validation logic, constraints,
     policies, conditional behavior, and business invariants
   - **entities.md**: Entities, relationships, data structures,
     attributes, lifecycle states, and entity interaction patterns
   - **frontend-components.md** (CONDITIONAL -- only if unit includes
     frontend/UI): Component hierarchy, props/state design, interaction flows,
     form validation rules, API integration points

5. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit's Functional Design artifacts.
   Do not edit state; report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

6. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Outputs

| Artifact                 | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| functional-spec.md  | Algorithms, workflows, data transformations, processing sequences, decision trees |
| rules.md        | Decision rules, validation logic, constraints, policies, conditional behavior |
| entities.md       | Entities, relationships, data structures, attributes, lifecycle states   |
| frontend-components.md   | (CONDITIONAL) Component hierarchy, props/state, interaction flows, form validation, API integration |

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes

- The questions file is co-located with stage artifacts at
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/functional-design-questions.md`.
- frontend-components.md is only produced when the unit includes frontend/UI
  work.
- All questions use the tri-mode interaction flow (Guide me / I'll edit the
  file / Chat).

| Outputs           | `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` -- performance-requirements.md, security-requirements.md, scalability-requirements.md, reliability-requirements.md, observability-requirements.md, tech-stack-decisions.md |

### Purpose

Define non-functional requirements across performance, security, scalability,
reliability, observability, and technology selection for a single unit. The aidlc-architect-agent
leads, with the aidlc-devsecops-agent providing security input, the
aidlc-compliance-agent providing regulatory input, and the aidlc-quality-agent
providing testability and measurability input.

### Inputs

- Functional design artifacts from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if they exist)
- Requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- Reverse engineering artifacts from
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` (if they exist)

### Steps

1. **Read Prior Artifacts** -- Read functional design artifacts (if they
   exist), requirements, and reverse engineering artifacts.

2. **Assess NFR Categories** -- Analyze the unit across NFR categories:
   - **Performance**: Response times, throughput, latency targets, resource
     utilization
   - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance
     requirements
   - **Scalability**: Load handling, growth projections, scaling strategies
   - **Reliability**: Availability targets, fault tolerance, disaster recovery,
     data durability
   - **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, alerting, tracing requirements

3. **Generate Questions** -- Create a questions file at
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/nfr-requirements-questions.md`
   for unclear NFR areas using `[Answer]:` tags. Focus on quantifiable targets
   and specific constraints.

4. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md question flow. Perform MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   - Identify vague answers ("fast enough", "highly available", "secure")
   - Check for contradictions between NFR targets
   - Flag missing quantitative targets
   - If ANY ambiguity found: create follow-up questions and resolve before
     proceeding

5. **Generate Artifacts** -- Generate the following in
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/`:
   - **performance-requirements.md**: Response time targets, throughput
     requirements, latency budgets, resource constraints, benchmarks
   - **security-requirements.md**: Authentication requirements, authorization
     model, data protection, compliance, threat considerations
   - **scalability-requirements.md**: Load projections, scaling triggers,
     capacity planning, data growth, concurrency targets
   - **reliability-requirements.md**: Availability targets (SLA/SLO), fault
     tolerance requirements, backup/recovery, graceful degradation
   - **observability-requirements.md**: Monitoring requirements, logging
     standards, distributed tracing needs, alerting thresholds, dashboard
     requirements, SLI/SLO definitions
   - **tech-stack-decisions.md**: Technology selections and rationale --
     languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure tools, and justification
     for each choice

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit's NFR Requirements artifacts.
   Do not edit state; report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

7. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Outputs

| Artifact                     | Description                                                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| performance-requirements.md  | Response times, throughput, latency budgets, resource constraints, benchmarks |
| security-requirements.md     | Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance, threats        |
| scalability-requirements.md  | Load projections, scaling triggers, capacity planning, concurrency         |
| reliability-requirements.md  | Availability targets (SLA/SLO), fault tolerance, backup/recovery           |
| observability-requirements.md | Monitoring, logging, tracing, alerting, dashboards, SLI/SLO definitions    |
| tech-stack-decisions.md      | Technology selections with rationale for each choice                       |

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes -- NFR Granularity Expansion

This stage produces **6 artifact files**, expanded from the upstream reference
which defines only 2 files for NFR Requirements. This is a deliberate deviation
documented in SKILL.md ("Deliberate Deviations from Reference"). The finer
granularity improves traceability and allows per-concern review without
overloading a single document. The six files separate performance, security,
scalability, reliability, and observability into dedicated artifacts, and add
a dedicated tech-stack-decisions.md for technology selection rationale.

### Purpose

Translate NFR requirements into concrete design patterns and architectural
solutions. The aidlc-architect-agent leads with the aidlc-aws-platform-agent providing
infrastructure and platform input.

### Inputs

- NFR requirements from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/`
- Functional design artifacts from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if they exist)
- Domain design from `<record>/inception/domain-design/` for
  architectural context

### Steps

1. **Read Prior Artifacts** -- Read NFR requirements, functional design
   artifacts (if they exist), and domain design for architectural context.

2. **Generate Design Questions** -- Create a questions file at
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/nfr-design-questions.md`
   with context-appropriate questions using `[Answer]:` tags. Focus areas:
   - Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads, fallback strategies)
   - Scalability patterns (horizontal vs vertical, data partitioning, caching
     tiers)
   - Performance optimization (latency budgets, throughput targets, resource
     pooling)
   - Security approach (defense in depth, zero trust, encryption standards)
   - Observability approach (metrics and SLI/SLO targets, structured logging,
     tracing depth, alerting philosophy, dashboard needs)
   - Logical component boundaries (service isolation, failure domains, blast
     radius)

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md question flow. Perform MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   - Identify vague answers ("mix of", "not sure", "depends", "probably")
   - Check for contradictions between answers
   - Flag missing details needed for artifact generation
   - If ANY ambiguity found: create follow-up questions and resolve before
     proceeding

4. **Design NFR Solutions** -- Design concrete solutions for each NFR
   category:
   - **Performance**: Caching strategies, query optimization, connection
     pooling, async processing, CDN usage, lazy loading, pagination
   - **Security**: Authentication flows, authorization model, encryption (at
     rest and in transit), input validation, CSRF/XSS protection, secrets
     management, audit logging
   - **Scalability**: Horizontal/vertical scaling approach, load balancing,
     data partitioning/sharding, queue-based decoupling, stateless design
   - **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retry policies with backoff, health
     checks, graceful degradation, failover strategies, data replication
   - **Observability**: Metrics collection strategy, structured logging design,
     distributed tracing architecture, alerting rules, dashboard specifications,
     SLI/SLO tracking, correlation ID propagation

5. **Generate Artifacts** -- Generate the following in
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/`:
   - **performance-design.md**: Caching architecture, optimization strategies,
     resource pooling, async patterns, performance budgets
   - **security-design.md**: Authentication/authorization architecture,
     encryption design, input validation strategy, security headers, compliance
     controls
   - **scalability-design.md**: Scaling architecture, load distribution, data
     partitioning strategy, capacity thresholds, auto-scaling rules
   - **reliability-design.md**: Resilience patterns, circuit breaker
     configuration, retry policies, health check design, failover procedures,
     backup strategy
   - **observability-design.md**: Metrics collection architecture, structured
     logging design, distributed tracing strategy, alerting rules and escalation,
     dashboard specifications, SLI/SLO definitions, correlation ID propagation
   - **logical-components.md**: Logical infrastructure component inventory --
     service boundaries, failure domains, blast radius mapping, component
     isolation strategy, shared resource identification. Bridges NFR design
     decisions with Infrastructure Design by providing a component-level view
     of where NFR patterns apply.

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit's NFR Design artifacts. Do not
   edit state; report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

7. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes -- NFR Design Granularity

This stage produces **6 artifact files** (5 NFR-specific designs plus
logical-components.md), expanded from the upstream reference which defines only
2 files for NFR Design. This is a deliberate deviation documented in SKILL.md
("Deliberate Deviations from Reference"). The logical-components.md artifact
serves as a bridge between NFR design and Infrastructure Design (Stage 3.4)
by mapping where NFR patterns apply at the component level.

| Outputs           | `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/` -- infrastructure-specification.md (deployment + services + CONDITIONAL shared), monitoring-design.md, cicd-pipeline.md |

### Purpose

Design the infrastructure, deployment architecture, monitoring, and CI/CD
pipeline for a single unit. The aidlc-aws-platform-agent leads, with the
aidlc-devsecops-agent ensuring infrastructure security and the
aidlc-compliance-agent checking data residency and regulatory constraints.

### Inputs

- NFR design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Functional design from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if exists)
- Domain design from `<record>/inception/domain-design/`
- NFR requirements from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` (if exists)

### Steps

1. **Read Prior Artifacts** -- Read all prior design artifacts for context:
   NFR design, functional design, domain design, NFR requirements.

2. **Generate Infrastructure Questions** -- Create a questions file at
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/infrastructure-design-questions.md`
   with context-appropriate questions using `[Answer]:` tags. Focus areas:
   - Deployment strategy (containerized, serverless, hybrid, multi-region)
   - Compute/storage/networking (sizing, topology, latency requirements)
   - Monitoring approach (metrics, logging, tracing, alerting thresholds)
   - CI/CD pipeline (build stages, deployment strategy, rollback procedures)
   - Secrets management (vault, environment variables, rotation policy)
   - Scaling policy (auto-scaling triggers, capacity limits, cost constraints)

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md question flow. Perform MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   - Identify vague answers ("cloud-based", "auto-scale", "standard
     monitoring")
   - Check for contradictions between answers
   - Flag missing details needed for artifact generation
   - If ANY ambiguity found: create follow-up questions and resolve before
     proceeding

4. **Design Infrastructure** -- Design infrastructure across four areas:
   - **Deployment Architecture**: Compute model (containers, serverless, VMs),
     networking topology, storage strategy, environment layout
     (dev/staging/prod)
   - **Infrastructure Services**: Databases (type, sizing, replication), caches
     (strategy, eviction), message queues, search services, CDN, DNS, load
     balancers
   - **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics collection, log aggregation,
     distributed tracing, alerting rules, dashboards, SLI/SLO tracking
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build stages, test stages, deployment stages,
     environment promotion, rollback strategy, feature flags, artifact
     management

5. **Generate Artifacts** -- Generate the following in
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/`. Keep the content
   **tabular** (deployment, services, shared, and monitoring are tables):
   - **infrastructure-specification.md**: the core infra design — a
     **Deployment** table (compute, networking, storage, environments, IaC,
     sizing), an **Infrastructure Services** table (databases, caches,
     messaging, integrations, service discovery), and a CONDITIONAL **Shared
     Infrastructure** table (shared resources across units + ownership/access
     boundaries), all in one document
   - **monitoring-design.md**: the monitoring that implements NFR Design's
     observability-design strategy, tabular — metrics/KPIs,
     alerts, SLIs/SLOs, plus log-aggregation and tracing configuration and
     dashboard specifications
   - **cicd-pipeline.md**: pipeline stages, build configuration, test
     automation integration, deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling),
     rollback procedures, environment promotion, secrets management in CI/CD

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit's Infrastructure Design
   artifacts. Do not edit state; report the gate outcome through
   `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

7. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Outputs

| Artifact                       | Description                                                               |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| infrastructure-specification.md | Deployment (compute/networking/storage/environments/IaC), infrastructure services, and CONDITIONAL shared resources — tabular |
| monitoring-design.md           | Metrics, alerts, SLIs/SLOs, logs, tracing, dashboards — tabular where possible |
| cicd-pipeline.md               | Pipeline stages, build config, deployment strategy, rollback procedures   |

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes -- Infrastructure Design Consolidation

This stage produces **3 artifact files**. Deployment, infrastructure services,
and shared resources were consolidated into a single tabular
`infrastructure-specification.md` (closer to the upstream reference's single
infra doc), while `monitoring-design.md` and `cicd-pipeline.md` stay dedicated
artifacts because downstream Operation stages consume them independently
(observability-setup reads monitoring; deployment-pipeline reads the CI/CD
design). Shared infrastructure is a CONDITIONAL section of the specification,
present only when multiple units share resources.

| Outputs           | application code (workspace root) + `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/` -- code-generation-plan.md, code-generation-questions.md, unit-test-instructions.md, code-summary.md, traceability.json, plus engine-required companion source-manifest.json |

### Purpose

Generate all application code, tests, and configuration for a single unit of
work. This is the only stage that always executes for every unit regardless of
the execution plan. Code is written to the workspace root, never to
`<record>/`.

### Critical Rules

- Application code goes to workspace root, NEVER to `<record>/`
- Brownfield: modify files in-place. NEVER create duplicates like
  `ClassName_modified.java`
- Add `data-testid` attributes to interactive UI elements for test automation
- Before review, write the engine-required companion `source-manifest.json`
  listing every application-source path this unit created, modified, or deleted,
  including files written by shell commands, scaffolding, or generators
- Measurable quality targets from NFR Requirements, NFR Design, and the Testing
  Contract coverage floor are inputs, not suggestions. NEVER relax, lower, or
  disable a defined target, including threshold settings in test or build
  configuration, to make a step pass; surface the gap instead.

### Inputs

- Functional design from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if exists)
- NFR requirements from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` (if exists)
- NFR design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Infrastructure design from
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/` (if exists)
- Domain design from `<record>/inception/domain-design/`
- Unit definition from
  `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md`
- Story map from
  `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work-story-map.md`

### Steps

This stage has a **two-part structure**: planning followed by generation.

#### PART 1 -- Planning (Steps 1-3)

1. **Read All Unit Artifacts** -- Read all design artifacts for the current
   unit (functional design, NFR requirements, NFR design, infrastructure
   design, domain design, unit definition, story map).

2. **Create Code Generation Plan** -- Create a detailed plan at
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/code-generation-plan.md`
   with checkboxes for each implementation step. Include story-to-code-step
   traceability -- map each plan step back to the user story it implements.

   Run `aidlc-testing-posture.ts render` and paste its complete
   `## Testing Contract` JSON block into the plan. The resolver reads
   org/team/project Testing Posture sections additively: a project coverage or
   integration note remains applicable but does not erase a team methodology;
   a contradictory narrower methodology is rejected.

   The contract supplies a methodology-specific plan profile:

   - **TDD** -- Red/Green/Refactor for every applicable testable layer: data,
     repository, business logic, API, and frontend.
   - **BDD** -- executable behavior scenarios before an observable feature
     slice, followed by cross-layer implementation, green scenarios, and
     refactoring. It is not converted to layer-local TDD.
   - **ATDD** -- executable acceptance tests before the complete cross-layer
     feature implementation, followed by acceptance-green and refactoring.
   - **Custom/mixed** -- the exact affirmed ordering is preserved, including
     combinations such as scenario-first BDD with lower-level unit tests after
     implementation.
   - **Test-after** -- implementation then tests for every applicable testable
     layer.

   Greenfield plans bootstrap a minimal runnable test command before the first
   Red/scenario/acceptance step; brownfield plans verify the existing command
   first. The selected Test Strategy supplies volume/types and the scope adds
   its floor (coverage/CI, targeted regression, or no additional floor);
   neither obligation replaces the other. Under Minimal, a bug/security
   targeted regression may add one integration/E2E test when that is the
   narrowest level that reproduces the defect.

   **Test files are MANDATORY in the plan.** The plan MUST include steps for:
   - Unit test files (one per component/module with key behavior coverage)
   - Test configuration (vitest.config, jest.config, or equivalent)

   If the plan omits test file steps, they must be added before presenting to
   the user. Tests are not deferred to Build and Test -- that stage verifies
   and extends, not creates from scratch.

   Number each plan step sequentially (Step 1, Step 2, etc.) for clear
   execution ordering and traceability.

   Resolve one code-generation record directory from the directive:
   `<record>/construction/<directive.unit>/code-generation/` when
   `directive.unit` is present, otherwise the zero-Unit stage directory
   `<record>/construction/code-generation/`. Also create
   `unit-test-instructions.md` there before Plan Approval. Match the active test
   strategy:
   - **Minimal**: Requirement-driven unit tests (1 test per requirement,
     happy-path floor per component), approximately 5-15 tests total
   - **Standard**: 5-8 tests per component, with key behavior coverage
   - **Comprehensive**: 10-15 tests per component, with thorough coverage

   Include test framework setup and configuration, the exact runnable command
   available before the first test-first cycle, expected coverage targets,
   mocking/stubbing guidance, and test data management. Every run command MUST
   be scoped to this unit using exact test file paths or an exact unit filter.
   A bare project-wide command such as `npm test` is not acceptable because
   Build and Test executes every unit's commands.

   Present the unit test instruction summary together with the plan summary.

3. **Plan Approval** -- Request approval for both
   `code-generation-plan.md`, its Testing Contract, and
   `unit-test-instructions.md`. When reapproval is required, reset the prior
   `[Answer]:` to blank first. After both files are final, run
   `aidlc-testing-posture.ts fingerprint --unit <unit>` for a unit directive or
   `aidlc-testing-posture.ts fingerprint --stage-level` for zero-Unit
   stage-level work. Then
   create or reset `code-generation-questions.md` in the resolved record
   directory with BOTH tags the command prints (`[Approval Fingerprint]` and
   `[Planned Source]`), a **Plan Approval** question,
   and blank `[Answer]:`; render it as a structured question and stop the turn:
   - "Approve Plan" -- proceed to code generation
   - "Request Changes" -- revise the plan

   Fill the tag only after the human responds. A request for changes is
   recorded, both files are revised as needed, the contract/fingerprint are
   regenerated, and the Plan Approval tag is reset before re-prompting. A
   postapproval plan, instruction, or Testing Contract edit for the same target
   and attempt reopens approval when the effective plan-approval fence is on
   (`strict` by default or explicit `guard.plan-approval on`). If lowered by
   `relaxed`, `off`, or `guard.plan-approval off`, continue with the updated
   content without resetting the answer or re-fingerprinting the approval.
   Preserve the original evidence; the edited content was not thereby approved.
   Testing Posture, scope, strategy, or project type changes follow that same
   rule: refresh the current contract and instructions as needed, and continue
   without reapproval if the fence remains lowered for the same intent, target,
   and attempt. A different intent or target, a new attempt, or missing actual
   initial approval still requires its own approval. Workspace-source changes follow
   the applicable source-drift policy. Re-running `next`, or a reissued
   directive for the same target and attempt, never reopens it. A forwarding-loop
   continuation is never approval.

   `testing-posture verify` reports `execution_allowed: true` with exit 0 when
   continuation is permitted, even if `ok: false` says the current content is
   not approved. Use that execution result; `begin` and `brief` honor it too.
   The friendly `reason` explains continuation; `approval_reason` keeps the
   stale binding detail and is not a new approval stop. When both content and
   source changed, read-only `verify` also previews the source change in
   `change_notices`. Generation start, including guard dispatch and swarm
   preparation, records and announces the accepted source change and
   re-baselines source provenance under the lowered fence. The original
   approval fingerprint, answer, and session remain unchanged. Existing delegated
   workers follow the live fence of their verified parent intent, including
   later lowering or raising.
   Missing artifacts or malformed or structurally incomplete Testing Contracts
   need repair before execution, not an automatic new approval ceremony.
   `obligations.strategy` must match `test_strategy`; both `strategy_volume`
   and `scope_floor` must contain nonblank obligations.
   A lowered fence also leaves execution provenance mandatory: before generation
   starts, an unbindable source or a failed runtime/audit publication blocks the
   operation. Repair that operational failure and retry with the same approval
   and fence setting. A valid human-issued break-glass receipt retains its
   existing source-binding exception.
   Lowering the per-work fence does not replace genuine initial approval,
   executable artifacts, or current target/attempt authority. Direct writes and
   developer dispatch validate every selected target before publishing any
   generation start. Repairing the plan records remains available while those
   execution requirements are unmet.
   A dispatch selecting multiple targets holds the generation authority locks
   across the whole start. If any target fails or source changes during
   publication, every receipt newly started by that dispatch is restored.
   Retry then checks the current source again; the original approvals and
   lowered fence settings remain unchanged.

#### PART 2 -- Generation (Steps 4-7)

4. **Generate Code** -- Before delegating, display to the user:
   "Generating code for [N] plan steps. This may take several minutes
   depending on project complexity. I'll show a summary when complete."

   Delegate to Task tool with the aidlc-developer-agent subagent
   (subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent").

   **Context passed to subagent:**
   - First, verbatim, the output of `aidlc-testing-posture.ts brief --unit
     <unit>` (or `--stage-level`). Its first line is the exact target marker,
     `AIDLC-UNIT: <directive.unit>` for unit work or
     `AIDLC-STAGE: code-generation` for a zero-Unit directive; its second line
     is `AIDLC-TESTING-CONTRACT: <contract_sha256>` from the current plan. With
     its fence on, the dispatch guard rejects missing, different, or stale
     hashes. Contextual dependencies do not receive additional target markers.
   - The lead agent's persona from `agents/aidlc-developer-agent.md` and knowledge
     from `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-developer-agent/` (included in the prompt
     since subagents cannot access conversation history)
   - Design artifacts for the CURRENT UNIT ONLY (not all units)
   - A 1-2 line summary of each inception-phase artifact with its file path
     (requirements summary, stories summary, app design summary) -- the
     subagent can Read specific files if it needs full content
   - The current plan and unit-test-instructions.md, which that
     output already carries using the approval-content projection: the plan
     with a terminal `## Review` appendix removed, task markers reset, and
     spacing normalized, plus the instructions byte for byte. The fingerprint
     excludes the appendix, so it is not work to execute; with its fence on,
     the dispatch guard refuses a handoff that quotes it. After permitted
     postapproval edits, use the current brief without calling the edits approved
   - Project workspace details (languages, frameworks, conventions from
     aidlc-state.md)
   - Instructions to execute each plan step sequentially and mark checkboxes
     as completed
   - The Testing Contract in the current brief is authoritative. The subagent
     does not independently re-resolve memory; it executes that contract's TDD, BDD, ATDD,
     test-after, or custom/mixed profile exactly.
   - Measurable quality targets from NFR Requirements, NFR Design, and the
     Testing Contract coverage floor are inputs, not suggestions. The subagent
     must NEVER relax, lower, or disable a defined target, including threshold
     settings in test or build configuration, to make a step pass; it must
     surface the gap instead.

   **Context budget:** Pass only the current unit's design artifacts, not all
   units. Summarize inception artifacts with file paths rather than embedding
   full content. The subagent generates all code, test files, and
   configuration artifacts in the workspace.

5. **Generate Code Summary and Source Manifest** -- After the subagent
   completes, create
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/code-summary.md`
   documenting:
   - Files created/modified
   - Key implementation decisions
   - Test coverage summary
   - Any deviations from the plan

   Also create
   `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/source-manifest.json`.
   This is a strict version-1 JSON companion file, not a declared `produces[]`
   artifact. It records `stage: "code-generation"`, the exact unit name, and a
   `writes` array containing every application-source path the unit created,
   modified, or deleted, including shell-, scaffolding-, and generator-written
   files. Paths are POSIX-relative and use no globs or `..`; a trailing `/`
   claims a generated directory tree. In a main-workspace multi-repo run every
   entry names its recorded `repo`; inside the worktree hosting the Bolt, paths are relative
   to that selected repo and omit `repo`.

   The engine validates this schema and refuses to record a terminal per-unit
   review without it. Its bytes and claims join the `Unit Source Fingerprint`;
   changed stage-source paths outside all fresh reviewed manifests block
   completion.

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit's code and summary artifacts.
   Do not edit state; report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

7. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Outputs

| Artifact                  | Description                                                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| code-generation-plan.md   | Detailed plan with checkboxes, story traceability, step sequencing  |
| code-generation-questions.md | Persisted Plan Approval question and explicit human answer       |
| unit-test-instructions.md | Per-unit setup, scoped run commands, coverage, mocks, and test data |
| code-summary.md           | Files created/modified, decisions, test coverage, plan deviations   |
| traceability.json         | Structured coverage of assigned upstream IDs by code/test targets   |
| source-manifest.json      | Engine-required strict companion attribution index; deliberately not in `produces[]` |
| (application code)        | All source code, tests, and config written to workspace root        |

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes

- **Two-part structure**: The planning phase (Steps 1-3) runs inline with user
  interaction and plan approval. The generation phase (Steps 4-7) delegates to
  the aidlc-developer-agent subagent via the Task tool. This is different from most
  Construction stages which run entirely inline.
- **Developer-agent subagent**: Code generation uses `subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent"`
  (delegated via Task tool), not inline execution. This is the only
  Construction stage that uses a subagent. The subagent inherits the full
  session toolset (the aidlc-developer-agent declares no `tools:` allowlist),
  so it reaches Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash, AskUserQuestion, and the
  inherited MCP tools.
- **Context budget**: Only the current unit's design artifacts are passed to
  the subagent. Inception-phase artifacts are summarized in 1-2 lines with
  file paths so the subagent can selectively Read what it needs.
- **Mandatory test file inclusion**: Test files MUST be part of the code
  generation plan. Stage 3.6 (Build and Test) verifies and extends tests but
  does not create them from scratch.
- **Source-manifest enforcement**: `source-manifest.json` is engine-validated,
  not a Markdown `required-sections` target. Its strict schema and
  `Unit Source Fingerprint` bind every exact/directory source claim; the engine
  refuses the terminal review when it is absent or invalid and refuses stage
  completion for changed source outside the fresh reviewed claims union.
- **Unit-scoped execution**: Each per-unit test instruction file uses exact
  test paths or an exact unit filter so the cross-unit execution stage does
  not rerun the project-wide suite for every unit.
- **Brownfield awareness**: In brownfield projects, the subagent modifies
  existing files in-place rather than creating duplicates.

### Purpose

Generate cross-unit test instructions, consume the per-unit unit test
instructions, then actually execute the build and tests via Bash. This stage
operates across ALL units -- it is NOT per-unit. The aidlc-quality-agent leads
with the aidlc-devsecops-agent providing security testing expertise.

### Inputs

- Code generation outputs across all units from
  `<record>/construction/*/code-generation/code-summary.md`
- Per-unit test instructions from
  `<record>/construction/*/code-generation/unit-test-instructions.md`
- Every applicable artifact under each unit's `nfr-requirements/` and
  `nfr-design/` directory
- Every current `## Testing Contract` in the stage-level or per-unit
  `code-generation-plan.md`, including postapproval edits permitted by a lowered
  plan-approval fence; those edits are not described as human-approved

### Steps

1. **Analyze Testing Requirements** -- Read code generation summaries and
   per-unit test instructions across all units. Build a source-complete
   inventory of every measurable target from NFR Requirements, NFR Design, and
   every current Testing Contract. For each target, record a stable ID, source
   path/section, expected value, the check that produces its actual value, and
   any later validation stage that owns it. Catalog all required test types.

2. **Generate Build Instructions** -- Create
   `<record>/construction/build-and-test/build-instructions.md`:
   - Dependency installation steps
   - Environment setup (env vars, config files, local services)
   - Build commands (compile, bundle, transpile)
   - Build verification steps
   - Troubleshooting common build issues

3-7. **Generate Additional Test Instructions** -- Consult the active test
   strategy and generate the matching cross-unit instruction files:
   - **Minimal**: Generate no additional files. Unit tests are covered
     per-unit by Code Generation.
   - **Standard**: Generate `integration-test-instructions.md` for key
     boundaries and cross-unit interactions.
   - **Comprehensive**: Generate integration instructions, plus
     `performance-test-instructions.md` when performance NFRs exist and
     `security-test-instructions.md` when security NFRs exist.
   - At any strategy, add specifically named contract, E2E, accessibility, or
     other instruction files when the project context requires them.

   All files go in `<record>/construction/build-and-test/`.
   Each file includes framework setup, run commands and filters, coverage
   targets, and test data or environment setup.

8. **Generate Build and Test Summary** -- Create
   `<record>/construction/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md`:
   - Overall build status and prerequisites
   - Test type inventory (which test types were generated)
   - Coverage expectations per unit
   - A Target Verification Matrix with Target ID, Source, Expected, Actual,
     Evidence, Owning Stage, and Verdict
   - Applicable targets begin `Pending`; `N/A` is valid only when the
     source-complete inventory found no applicable measurable target
   - Readiness assessment (build-ready, test-ready, deployment-ready)
   - Known limitations or outstanding items

9. **Execute Build and Tests** -- Attempt to execute the build and test
    commands documented in the instruction files **via Bash**:

    a. **Build**: Run the build commands from build-instructions.md via Bash.
       Capture output.
    b. **Unit tests**: Collect commands from every per-unit
       `code-generation/unit-test-instructions.md`, deduplicate identical
       commands, and run each distinct command once. Commands should be
       unit-scoped; if a file contains a project-wide command, run it once,
       never once per unit. Report per-unit pass/fail without double counting.
    c. **Integration tests** (if applicable): Run integration test commands.
       Capture results.
    d. **Other applicable checks**: Run every applicable command from
       performance, security, contract, E2E, accessibility, and other generated
       instruction files. Defer only a check that requires a deployed or
       production-like environment and has a named owning validation stage in
       the current execution plan. Record that stage and its expected evidence
       path; the target remains `Unverified` and cannot make this stage
       successful. Without a scheduled owning stage, it is simply
       `Unverified`.
    e. **Finalize and report results**: Create or update
       `<record>/construction/build-and-test/test-results.md` and
       `build-and-test-summary.md` on every exit path with:
       - Build status (success/failure + output)
       - Test results (total, passed, failed, skipped)
       - Failure details (test name, assertion, stack trace)
       - Coverage report (if test framework supports it)
       - The finalized Target Verification Matrix. Every applicable target has
         an actual value, evidence, owning stage, and final `Met`, `Not Met`, or
         `Unverified` verdict. No `Pending` verdict remains after Step 9.
       - `## Loop-Back Log` (only when the failure ladder's rung 3 or 4 fires
         a loop-back): one `### Loop-back N -- <ISO timestamp>` entry per
         attempt (Diagnosis / Root-cause stage / Planned fix / Estimated impact).
         Append-only; survives re-runs (Modify, never Redo, on loop-back
         re-entry).

    **Failure-escalation ladder:** The stage has failed when a build or test
    command fails or an applicable target is `Not Met` or `Unverified`. Finalize
    the matrix and summary before entering the same ladder for every failure
    kind. Lowering, relaxing, or disabling a target is never an acceptable fix.

    1. **In-stage fix (max 2 attempts)** -- for root causes inside this
       stage's own remit (test config, build scripts, environment setup, or an
       executable target check): read the evidence, identify the failing
       configuration or scaffolding, apply the fix, re-run the failing step,
       and refresh the target matrix.
    2. **Classify and estimate impact** -- when in-stage attempts are exhausted or the
       diagnosis points upstream: decide whether the root cause lies in
       generated source or test code -- regardless of defect size -- or a
       code-generation approach choice (library/version, container image,
       instance type, algorithm, flag); find a fix in a swappable dimension
       and ESTIMATE ITS IMPACT (effort, financial cost, risk). Never declare a
       feasible path out of scope on an impact-unestimated effort assumption.
    3. **Autonomous bounded loop-back** -- if `Construction Autonomy Mode:
       autonomous`, an impact-estimated fix exists, and fewer than 3 entries exist under
       `## Loop-Back Log`: record the diagnosis + impact-estimated fix, jump
       back to code-generation via the engine, and replay forward through its
       settlement-aware route per the construction protocol module
       (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md`),
       "Build-and-Test failure loop-back". The failed run's gate is not
       presented; its enabled learnings ritual defers to the eventual passing run. When the `learnings` module is absent, no diary or ritual runs.
    4. **Halt-and-ask** -- gated/unset mode, bound exhausted, or no
       identifiable fix: log the failure and present the halt-and-ask
       question from the construction protocol module
       (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md`) -- the
       impact-estimated 3-option variant (Retry with fix [estimated impact] /
       Accept failure / Abort) when a candidate fix exists, or the no-fix
       2-option variant (Accept failure / Abort) when rung 2 found none.

    **Loop-back replay routing:** If Code Generation never used unit lifecycle
    receipts, preserved artifacts can take the all-covered `gate: true` fast
    path; apply the planned fix and deterministic Modify/Keep decisions before
    that gate. Once any lifecycle row exists, receipt mode is sticky and the
    jump re-emits per-Unit work: re-mint `unit start` / `unit complete`, apply
    Modify to targeted Units and Keep to the rest, and run the declared reviewer
    per Unit. Both paths MUST record a fresh current-attempt
    `REVIEW_COMPLETED` for every applicable Unit before the settle/approval
    gate because `STAGE_JUMPED` invalidates all earlier reviews. Under
    unit-major the swarm never fires; replay follows the serial per-Unit walk.
    A revised Code Generation plan still requires fresh human Plan Approval.

    The replay repairs the Code Generation plan under a NEW stage attempt, so the
    prior approval no longer applies. Record the delta in the Loop-Back Log, then
    reset the Plan Approval `[Answer]:`, regenerate the fingerprint, and run the
    full decision/human-turn/answer receipt sequence again before any fix
    generation. The gated "Retry with fix" choice authorizes the jump; it is not
    approval of the revised plan.

    **Swarm cheap path:** A jump creates a new exact stage-attempt `Run floor`
    boundary token, so stale convergence rows cannot count. Park/discard stale
    worktrees/branches and run a fresh `prepare`; they cannot be adopted into
    the new attempt because `finalize` requires its current prepare stamp.
    The saved abort result's or doctor's `restore_operation`, when present,
    recovers parked files separately, not their current-attempt authority.
    Invoke its `worktree` engine route with each listed arg exactly as argv,
    never joined into a shell command. Hints and rendered commands are human
    display text only; rendering errors do not remove typed operations.
    Evidence-only attempts have no restore operation or files to restore. Run
    `check` first. A green Unit can skip a builder turn, but it still needs a
    terminal current-attempt reviewer receipt in the fresh worktree before it
    enters `finalize --claimed`; `finalize` verifies that receipt's current
    artifact fingerprint as well as the attempt stamp.

    Single-stage runs (`--single`) stop at rung 2 -- there is no
    main-workflow position to move; the impact-estimated options are logged and
    presented in that run's isolated-run summary.

    **On success:** A successful readiness result requires every command to
    pass and every applicable target to be `Met`, or the single explanatory
    `N/A` row when no target applies.

10. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the build/test evidence. Do not edit
    stage or phase state; the reported gate outcome owns the transition.

11. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes

- **Actual Bash execution**: This stage does not just document test
  instructions -- it actually runs the build and test commands via Bash and
  captures real results. This is one of the few stages that executes
  real commands against the codebase.
- **Quality target evidence**: The source-complete matrix is finalized on every
  exit path. Deployed-environment checks may name a later owning stage, but
  remain `Unverified`; `Not Met` and `Unverified` both enter the failure ladder.
- **Failure-escalation ladder**: In-stage fixes are bounded at 2 attempts;
  when the root cause lies upstream in generated code or a code-generation
  approach choice, the stage classifies and estimates the impact of a fix, then either runs
  the bounded autonomous loop-back to code-generation (max 3, counted by the
  append-only `## Loop-Back Log` in test-results.md) or presents the impact-estimated
  halt-and-ask question. See the construction protocol module
  (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md`),
  "Build-and-Test failure loop-back". Re-entry is settlement-aware, preserves
  the approved plan, and cannot reach its gate until every applicable Code
  Generation Unit has a fresh current-attempt review.
- **Conditional test types**: Performance tests, security tests, contract
  tests, E2E tests, and accessibility tests are only generated when relevant
  conditions are met (NFR requirements exist, microservice architecture,
  UI-driven application, user-facing interfaces).
- **Cross-unit scope**: Unlike stages 3.1-3.5 which are per-unit, Build and
  Test runs once across all code produced by all units. It validates the
  integrated codebase, not individual units.
- **Phase completion**: This stage (along with 3.7 if applicable) marks the
  end of the Construction phase. The final approved report makes the engine
  mark Construction complete and route to Operation atomically.

### Purpose

Configure the CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline with quality gates,
artifact management, and build/test automation. The aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent
leads with no support agents.

### Inputs

- Build/test results from `<record>/construction/build-and-test/`
- Infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/infrastructure-design/`
  (if exists)
- Workspace profile for existing CI configuration

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read build/test results, infrastructure design
   (if exists), and workspace profile for existing CI configuration.

2. **Generate Clarifying Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/construction/ci-pipeline/ci-pipeline-questions.md` with
   questions:
   - What CI tool is in use (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions,
     Jenkins)?
   - What is the branch strategy?
   - What quality gates are required before merge?
   - What artifact repositories are used (ECR, CodeArtifact, S3)?

   Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Validate CI choices against existing
   infrastructure and team capabilities.

4. **Generate Artifacts** -- Create CI pipeline configuration (buildspec.yml,
   workflow YAML, or equivalent), quality gate definitions, and artifact
   repository configuration.

5. **Phase Boundary Verification** -- Run Construction-to-Operation
   verification check:
   - Architecture-to-code-to-tests alignment
   - All code traces to design
   - Test coverage against acceptance criteria
   - Write results to `<record>/verification/phase-check-construction.md`

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the CI and boundary artifacts. Do not
   edit stage or phase state; the reported gate outcome owns the transition.

7. **Completion** -- Present completion message and approval gate.

### Outputs

| Artifact                  | Description                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ci-config.md              | CI pipeline configuration (buildspec, workflow YAML, etc.) |
| quality-gates.md          | Quality gate definitions for merge/promotion             |
| ci-pipeline-questions.md  | Clarifying questions with answers                        |

### Approval Gate

Strictly 2-option: Approve / Request Changes.

### Notes

- **Phase boundary verification**: This is the last stage of the Construction
  phase. It performs the Construction-to-Operation phase boundary verification
  check (per stage-protocol-governance.md section 13), validating that architecture traces
  to code and code traces to tests. Results are written to
  `<record>/verification/phase-check-construction.md`.
- **Conditional execution**: This stage is skipped if the project already has
  an adequate CI pipeline. The execution plan from Delivery Planning determines
  whether it runs.
- **Post-unit execution**: Like Stage 3.6, this stage runs once after all
  per-unit work is complete, not per-unit.

## Phase Summary

The Construction phase transforms Inception designs into working software
through a phased construction flow:

**Per-unit stages (3.1-3.5):**
- 3.1 Functional Design -- Business logic, domain models, rules (architect-led)
- 3.2 NFR Requirements -- Performance, security, scalability, reliability,
  observability, tech stack (architect-led)
- 3.3 NFR Design -- Concrete patterns for NFR categories (architect-led)
- 3.4 Infrastructure Design -- Deployment, services, monitoring, CI/CD
  (aws-platform-led)
- 3.5 Code Generation -- Two-part planning + generation via subagent
  (developer-led)

**Post-unit stages (3.6-3.7):**
- 3.6 Build and Test -- Instruction generation + actual Bash execution with
  failure diagnosis (quality-led)
- 3.7 CI Pipeline -- CI configuration + phase boundary verification
  (pipeline-deploy-led)

**Key characteristics:**
- Stages 3.1-3.4 are CONDITIONAL; 3.5-3.6 ALWAYS execute; 3.7 is CONDITIONAL
- All conditional stages follow the execution plan from Delivery Planning
- New source-producing solo Unit workflows default to unit-major, serial
  execution and verified Unit checkpoints. Preserve explicit iteration choices
  and the existing legacy, design-only, no-Unit, and team-owned paths.
- NFR artifacts use expanded granularity (6 files for requirements, 6 for
  design) compared to the upstream reference
- Infrastructure Design is expanded to 5 artifacts with dedicated monitoring
  and CI/CD files
- Code generation uses the aidlc-developer-agent subagent with context budget controls
- Build and Test performs actual command execution and automated failure
  diagnosis
- CI Pipeline includes phase boundary verification before transitioning to
  Operation

**Deliberate deviations from upstream reference:**
- NFR Requirements: 6 files (expanded from 2 in reference)
- NFR Design: 6 files including logical-components.md (expanded from 2 in
  reference)
- Infrastructure Design: 3 files — a consolidated infrastructure-specification.md
  (deployment + services + shared) plus dedicated monitoring-design.md and
  cicd-pipeline.md
- Plan/question file co-location with stage artifacts
