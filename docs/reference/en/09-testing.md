# Testing

## Overview

The AI-DLC test suite is **entirely TypeScript** — every test is a
`t*.test.ts` file run under `bun`, with zero shell (`.sh`) test files. This is
the platform-invariance guarantee by construction: the same files run
identically on macOS, Linux, and native Windows.

The suite is organized into **four levels** — `smoke`, `unit`, `integration`,
`e2e` — one directory each under `tests/`. The four levels map onto the
classic three-layer test pyramid that balances speed vs. thoroughness:

```
            /\
           /  \    ACCEPTANCE — full workflows, artifact + experience verification
          / L3 \   Level: e2e  ·  When: local --release/--all; pre-release confidence
         /------\
        /        \
       /   L2     \  STAGE — individual stages with stub input, verify artifacts
      /------------\ Level: integration  ·  When: local default/--ci; PR gates
     /              \
    /      L1        \  PROTOCOL — contracts, structure, cross-references
   /------------------\ Levels: smoke + unit  ·  When: local changes and PR CI
```

The `--ci` profile and the no-flag default both run **smoke + unit +
integration** (so the integration level rides along on every local
`bun tests/run-tests.ts`); `--release` / `--all` adds `e2e`. The pyramid above
shows where each level sits conceptually — the profile flags below are how you
actually select them.

The shared policy in `tests/harness/test-budget.ts` treats timeouts as failure
backstops. Cold imports, antivirus, process creation and provider scheduling vary
widely between runners; a fast run does not define a suitable timeout.
Unspecified deterministic cases get ten minutes on every OS. Choose a shared
profile for a whole fixture and remove smaller operational overrides:

| Workload | Default ceiling |
| --- | --- |
| Native process or CLI startup | 5 minutes |
| Runtime handoff fixture | 20 minutes |
| Compilation or projection generation | 15 minutes |
| Fixture setup and CLI-heavy case | 30 minutes |
| Whole multi-worktree case | 60 minutes |
| Live startup | 10 minutes |
| Live command or artifact-generation work | 30 minutes |

These are ceilings: successful operations return immediately. A timeout that a
test deliberately exercises remains explicit and short. Ownership, exit status,
recursion, human-boundary and other correctness assertions stay enforced.
Elapsed wall time is not a substitute for those assertions; use direct state or
an injected clock when the test is proving behavior rather than performance.

Production tools and standalone binary gates share operational defaults in
`core/tools/aidlc-runtime-budget.ts`; see [runtime and native hook budgets](06-hooks-and-tools.md#runtime-and-native-hook-budgets).
Explicit caller budgets and intentional responsiveness contracts remain
distinct from the default execution backstops.

Budget review includes nested subprocesses, setup, polling deadlines, cleanup and
CI limits. Increasing only Bun's case ceiling cannot fix a shorter child cap.
Driver operations use the actual remaining parent budget. Sequential operations
share that budget; do not reserve every later operation's maximum allowance.
The live-case helper supplies a generous Bun ceiling around the work, setup and
cleanup phases, while the file deadline remains authoritative. It does not
promise every phase its maximum after earlier work has consumed the file time.

Infrastructure uses the same shared policy:

| Operation | Default ceiling |
| --- | --- |
| Process identity discovery | 10 minutes |
| One process query or termination call | 5 minutes |
| Process-tree cleanup | 15 minutes |
| Supervisor exit and status publication | 17 minutes |
| Final terminal output drain | 2 minutes |
| Terminal client shutdown, including daemon retirement | 19.5 minutes total |
| Worker cleanup and confirmation | 20 minutes total |

These are maximum operation allowances. File cleanup reserves up to five
minutes once, and the parent deadline clips each operation's allowance.
`remainingCleanupTimeoutMs` spends the original hard deadline, including its
reserved tail, without subtracting the work reserve again. At hard expiry it
allows only a minimal immediate retirement attempt. The terminal client shares
one shutdown deadline across its RPC and daemon-retirement wait. Polling
returns as soon as the required evidence is available; missing identity or
retirement evidence still fails.

Every dispatched file has an independent supervisor deadline, including
ordinary integration/SDK files. `--file-timeout N` caps it in seconds (two hours
by default outside isolated E2E). `--run-timeout N` shares one work deadline
across setup and all selected files. Exhausted budgets fail visibly; they do not
skip required assertions. The run retains one cleanup cutoff, so finishing a
file's cleanup early cannot admit more work into that reserved time.
Drivers leave up to five minutes of the file envelope
for teardown, while the runner still retires owned processes and records a
failure if the work does not cooperate. These flags bound dispatched work;
coordinator retirement, fixture retention and report publication follow it.
Their native cleanup checks remain bounded, and CI's enclosing step/job limits
provide the final wall-clock backstop for collection. Uncertain process cleanup
retains its fixtures. Logs record the resolved allowance, absolute deadline and
cleanup reserve.

Distribution coverage is split by contract:

- `t145-packaging-parity.test.ts` proves that copy, native, and plugin
  projections are deterministic across two independent clean packager runs.
- `t238-build-binaries.test.ts` compiles and probes the standalone binary
  closure, including native routes, hooks/adapters, project mutation, and the
  final installed layout with no `bun` on `PATH`.
- `t242-plugin-state.test.ts` proves host inventory normalization, composition
  hashes, transactional sync rollback, and ownership-safe prune.
- `t243-install-mechanism.test.ts` covers archive rejection, the shared
  transaction engine and recovery paths, project init/refresh ownership,
  checksums, lifecycle, pins, offline packages, and copy/native projection
  separation.
- `t244-install-management.test.ts` covers machine configuration, update
  discovery, installer harness selection, Windows lifecycle surfaces,
  completions, and release-workflow candidate continuity.
- `t330-release-channel-grammar.test.ts` pins the closed stable and preview
  version-id grammar, the installer and lifecycle literals of it, and a preview
  install that runs through the launcher shim.
- `t331-preview-channel-lifecycle.test.ts` covers `config --channel`,
  channel-aware `update` and `update --check`, API failure as unavailable,
  switching back to stable, preview retention, and preview pins.
- `t332-preview-release-pipeline.test.ts` covers the annotated-tag prerelease
  publication, the preview planner and notes, and the plan record. It checks
  multiple changed-source previews on one UTC day, including a later manual run
  after a scheduled publication. Unchanged and overtaken sources skip; drafts and orphan tags
  permit retry planning with unoccupied ids. Workflow assertions cover
  a run planning and publishing the commit it started on after `main`
  advances,
  isolation of stable tags from scheduled/manual previews, shared
  `release-preview` concurrency, contract gate ancestry, channel-specific provenance
  signers, build stamping, and a failing Full Suite that still builds the preview
  without failing the preview workflow.
- `t-ci-preview-test-report.test.ts` covers the preview's Full Suite report:
  failing files and cases from each artifact's own run (never the runner's
  fixture runs), failed jobs, inert markup, and the report size budget.
- `t-ci-full-suite-evidence.test.ts` covers the stable release Full Suite gate:
  which earlier runs may supply evidence, which results qualify for the exact
  tagged commit, the fallback to running the suite, and the `release.yml` wiring
  that keeps publication behind a passing result.

The test runner regenerates all projections under a process lock before test
discovery, so a fresh clone has no dependency on pre-existing `dist/` bytes.
CI also runs an explicit package step before each job that consumes generated
trees. Binary and release packagers perform their own regeneration and
determinism checks before reading `dist-release/`.

Release CI adds native smoke on Linux, macOS, and Windows, builds the seven
target artifacts on their native runner architectures, and executes both musl
probes in disposable Alpine containers after installing the documented
`libgcc` and `libstdc++` runtime prerequisites shared by Bun and Node.js. The
musl matrix uses
`fail-fast: false` so both architectures report before CI stages one
checksum-verified candidate. Unix and Windows lifecycle
journeys consume those bytes without signing permissions. The workflow then
attests them and uploads one workflow artifact. `release` rechecks the tag and
checksums, creates the GitHub Release in the source repository with
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and compares the uploaded asset inventory with the candidate.
Publishing never rebuilds or repackages the candidate.

`tests/harness/release-fixture.ts` builds deterministic release directories
from the generated projection manifests and can serve them locally with
redirect, delay, truncation, captive-portal, oversized-metadata, and
missing-asset faults. Run
`bun tests/harness/release-fixture.ts --output <dir>` to author a fixture.
The normal suite stays offline; set `AIDLC_RELEASE_CONTRACT_LIVE=1` when
running t243 to opt into the public release metadata and checksum contract
check.

The deterministic e2e slice (`bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 --e2e --filter "^t[0-9]"`) runs in CI with `--no-llm`, while local development loops default to smoke + unit + integration. Branches that touch merge, worktree, or swarm paths should also run this slice locally before review rounds, because mode-boundary regressions between ordinary-Bolt and swarm execution are invisible to the default tier.

**Filename convention.** A test's filename is `t<NN>[-description].test.ts` —
just the level directory it lives in and an optional human description. There
is **no mechanism segment** in the name: a test's mechanism (whether it spawns
a CLI, drives the SDK, or renders a live TUI) is a *derived set* computed from
the drivers its body actually calls, not declared in the filename. The
machine-checked index of what each test covers is built fresh from the
`covers:` headers on disk by `tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts`, never kept in a
hand-maintained table here or committed. See [Test Registry](#test-registry)
below.

### Markdown adapter coverage

`markdownBlocks` in `core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts` is the single block interpreter for
visibility, containers, definitions, and claim splitting; `visibleMarkdownLines`
projects it. It is backed by the built-in `Bun.markdown` renderer. Tests defend
consumer outcomes rather than maintaining a second CommonMark oracle. The
separate `Bun.markdown.render` review-authority path keeps its existing
security coverage.

- `t341-markdown-blocks.test.ts` covers authored CommonMark/GFM block-boundary
  examples, exact inline code and HTML span columns, the four `Bun.markdown`
  deviations the adapter corrects (an empty task item, a table running into a
  heading or fence, a fence leaving its container, a tag indented under a
  paragraph), probes that must be dropped because they would change the
  rendering, lines without letters or digits, entity-spelled probe markers, the
  render budget, the digest's fail-closed question boundary, and control
  characters that must not forge the rendered tree.
- `t343-raw-html-consumer-contracts.test.ts` checks summary digests and answers,
  Change Control sections, and Plan Approval selection/re-baselining inside and
  outside raw HTML. `t344-visible-markdown-goldens.test.ts` pins unaffected
  visibility and digest bytes; `t345-receipt-scope-migration.test.ts` covers v1/v2
  receipt compatibility and parser-upgrade recovery.
- `t247-claim-sources-sensor.test.ts` defends both visibility safety directions:
  hidden text cannot ground a claim, and hidden fence-looking text cannot erase
  a real reference definition or shorten a confirmed assumption. Text after an
  HTML comment, processing instruction, declaration, CDATA section, or closing
  raw tag on the same line is a claim.

## Layer 1: Protocol (every change, no LLM, seconds)

Verifies the orchestrator's structural correctness without invoking the LLM. If these pass, the protocol is internally consistent — stages reference valid files, inputs/outputs chain correctly, routing tables match stage files.

**Levels:** smoke, unit, integration

**What it tests:**
- File existence, permissions, naming conventions (smoke)
- All 17 hook sources through copy/native dispatch, stage frontmatter, knowledge inventory (unit)
- Scope-stage mapping, graph consistency, stage I/O contract chains, protocol compliance (integration)
- Stage output-to-step validation: all declared outputs referenced in instruction steps (integration, deterministic via the `aidlc-validate.ts` CLI tool)
- Scope runs: every shipped scope driven from the person's first request to done (integration, `tests/integration/t-scope-run-*`; see below)
- Guard matrix: what the person meets when files change under approved work, per Guard Policy, review cap and plan approval (integration, `tests/integration/t-guard-matrix-*`; see below)

**Run:** `bun tests/run-tests.ts --no-llm`. The default profile includes the
integration level, so the run needs the LLM and opens the live-model gate
whenever the `claude` CLI is on PATH. `--no-llm` closes that gate and keeps this
layer LLM-free; the deterministic tests still run. `bash tests/run-tests.sh` is a
compatibility wrapper for existing POSIX commands. The scope runs and the guard
matrix run only when a `--filter` selects them, or with `--release`/`--all` (see
the CLI reference).

### Scope runs

`tests/harness/scope-run.ts` drives a shipped scope through the real engine with
no model. A scripted stand-in plays the agent: it runs the engine's commands as
the Claude skill does and fires the hooks Claude Code would fire. A separate
person script is the only part that answers a question or a gate, through the
human-turn hook, and every engine call runs under the production guard profile.
Each `t-scope-run-<scope>.test.ts` file checks state, audit records, directives
and files, never prose:

- the stages that run and the ones skipped match the stage files' `scopes:` lists;
- every decision recorded as the person's is backed by a turn the person script
  sent (`tests/harness/person-turns.ts`); when one is not, the turn ledger and
  each intent's audit trail and state are kept under
  `unbacked-decisions-<id>/` in the test's log folder, so the order of events
  survives the fixture's removal;
- the scope file's switches show in state and directives;
- the run ends done, with every output on disk.

`t-scope-run-new-scopes.test.ts` drives any shipped scope that has no file of its
own, so a new scope is covered the day it ships. `t-scope-run-moves-*` cover the
person's own words, settings typed with new work, a switch mid-run, and a stop
for the day then a resume. A stage with a new kind of step fails its run until
the stand-in learns that step. A known engine block the runs exempt is listed in
`KNOWN_STOP_BLOCKS` with a `test.todo` named after it. CI runs the scope runs as
their own integration job: Linux on pull requests and in the merge queue, and
Linux, macOS and Windows in the nightly Full Suite (its `scope_runs` job) and in
a `full_verification` Full Suite.

### Guard matrix

`tests/harness/guard-matrix.ts` uses the same stand-in to drive classic with two
Units (Requirements, Units Generation, Code Generation, Build and Test) under
each Guard Policy (`off`, `relaxed`, `strict`), review cap and plan approval
setting. Each `t-guard-matrix-<change>.test.ts` file makes one change at the
point a person makes it: a later Unit edits an approved Unit's file, a hand
edit, a plan edit while its approval waits, a pull mid-stage, a revert, a second
review the person asks for, an engine update between Units, the person's own
switch to off, a composed scope and classic as it ships. The document changes
walk Functional Design too: while Unit 2 builds, Unit 1's approved functional
design or code plan is edited (by Unit 2's agent or by the person), or the
design is deleted. Their `-waves` files run Functional Design stage by stage,
then the person asks for one Unit at a time. Every refusal the run meets is
followed: the person picks a remedy the engine offers, or the agent runs the
command it names. Each case checks:

- under Guard Policy off, nothing refuses the person or asks them again (for a
  changed document, the same under relaxed; a deleted one may cost the one stop
  that makes it again, and it must be made again);
- with the policy on, the person is asked at most once about the change;
- no refusal comes back after its step was taken (a deadlock);
- every decision recorded as the person's is backed by a turn they sent, and
  the run ends done;
- the record keeps at most one CHANGE_ACCEPTED row and one line for the person
  per changed Unit, naming what changed, and none when nothing changed.

A case the engine blocks today is a `test.todo` named after the block, with the
real check as its body, so the fix turns it on. CI runs the guard matrix where
it runs the scope runs, as a job of its own.

## Layer 2: Stage (CI push, LLM, minutes)

Runs individual stages in isolation with known workspace + state fixtures. Verifies each stage produces correct artifacts when given deterministic input.

**Levels:** integration

**What it tests:**
- Preflight health gate: Claude CLI on PATH, AWS credentials valid, Claude responds (exit 0), response non-empty (preflight)
- CLI tool utility handlers: intent-create, --doctor, --status, --stage, --phase (integration)
- Individual stages with greenfield/brownfield stubs, artifact verification (integration)

**Run:** `bun tests/run-tests.ts --ci`

## Layer 3: Acceptance (release, LLM, hours)

Runs full workflows and verifies the experience: beyond state transitions, it checks artifact content, cross-stage coherence, and domain correctness.

**Levels:** e2e

**What it tests:**
- Full bugfix lifecycle with brownfield stub + artifact assertions
- Full POC lifecycle with greenfield stub + artifact assertions
- State progression, scope routing, audit completeness, jump mechanics
- LLM semantic review of stage instruction quality (clarity, logical flow, ambiguity detection)

**Run:** `bun tests/run-tests.ts --release`

## Cross-Platform Coverage

The test suite runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows through the native Bun runner:

```bash
bun tests/run-tests.ts [--ci | --all --debug -P 8]
```

`bash tests/run-tests.sh ...` remains as a POSIX compatibility wrapper and delegates to the same TypeScript runner. Repository tests and copy-channel hooks/tools require `bun`; native release projections invoke hooks/tools through the installed `aidlc` binary. Bash is not the primary runner substrate.

Terminal sessions default to native `bun` on all three platforms; `tmux` is an
explicit alternative on Linux/macOS. On macOS, containment uses start-time-checked
process identities and an inherited `AIDLC_TUI_CONTAINMENT` token to find detached
double-fork descendants after they reparent to launchd. A descendant that both
escapes ancestry and execs with a scrubbed environment is undetectable on macOS;
Linux subreaper containment and Windows Job Objects do not have this limitation.

**Portability constraints baked into the suite:**

- **Paths**: `createTestProject` in `tests/harness/fixtures.ts` normalizes temporary project paths so they round-trip cleanly through JSON and native `bun`.
- **In-place edits**: Prefer TypeScript file writes in tests. If a shell helper is unavoidable, avoid BSD/GNU-specific `sed -i` forms.
- **`grep -qiF`**: Git Bash has a known bug combining `-i` and `-F`. Use `-i` alone if your pattern has no regex metacharacters. Tests hit this in t16 before it was fixed.
- **`tar` archives**: macOS `tar` injects `._*` AppleDouble sidecar files by default. When bundling source for cross-platform test runs, use `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar …` or `git archive`.
- **LLM timing on Windows**: Bedrock calls from Windows EC2 can be meaningfully slower than from macOS (first-call cold start, MSYS process fork overhead). SDK/tui tests should assert on driver result surfaces and let the runner's preflight/per-file Claude gate separate absent substrate from real failures.

**Running the suite on Windows manually:**

1. Install Bun **1.3.14 or newer**, Node.js for the suite's other tooling, and the Claude Code CLI.
2. Install Git for Windows if you are running the full suite or the POSIX wrapper compatibility smoke; the native runner path itself does not require Bash.
3. Install the repository's dev dependencies so Bun can resolve `@xterm/headless`. The default Windows TUI backend uses Bun's native PTY.
4. Set `AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1` for live Claude TUI coverage. Leave `AIDLC_TUI_BACKEND` unset or set it to `auto`/`bun`; use `AIDLC_BUN_BIN` to select a concrete `bun.exe` when needed.
5. For the Kiro IDE slice, install and sign in to Kiro IDE, then set `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_LIVE=1`. Run the GUI tests in that user's logged-in desktop session. A scheduled task can use “Run only when user is logged on” to launch the runner in this session. The default Windows binary is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Kiro\Kiro.exe`; override it with `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_BIN`.
6. Run `bun tests/run-tests.ts --all --debug -P 8`.

No WSL or Docker is required; the supported validation substrate is native Windows.

For Kiro CLI coverage, put the signed-in native `kiro-cli.exe` on `PATH`.
Pin `AIDLC_BUN_BIN` to the validated Bun executable and keep its directory first
on `PATH`; Kiro installations can include an older bundled Bun.
Set `AIDLC_KIRO_ACP_LIVE=1` for ACP files. For terminal files, set
`AIDLC_KIRO_TUI_LIVE=1` and `AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1`; the native Bun terminal backend
handles Windows input and screen capture. These files check the CLI, account,
and selected terminal backend before running, with the same journey assertions
on each supported platform.

**Repeatable MR10 Windows EC2 runbook:**

1. Stand up a disposable Windows Server 2022 host with SSM access:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy \
     --stack-name aidlc-windows-test \
     --template-file tests/harness/windows/windows-test.cfn.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
     --parameter-overrides VpcId=vpc-... SubnetId=subnet-...
   ```

2. Sync the committed git tree under test:

   ```bash
   bun tests/harness/windows/sync.ts --stack-name aidlc-windows-test HEAD
   ```

3. Install repo dev dependencies on the box:

   ```bash
   bun tests/harness/windows/ssm-run.ts --stack-name aidlc-windows-test -- \
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\aidlc\tests\harness\windows\setup.ps1 -ProjectDir C:\aidlc
   ```

4. Run the Windows `--all` gate with live TUI enabled:

   ```bash
   bun tests/harness/windows/ssm-run.ts --stack-name aidlc-windows-test -- \
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\aidlc\tests\harness\windows\run-all.ps1 -ProjectDir C:\aidlc -Parallel 8
   ```

5. Tear down the host:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name aidlc-windows-test
   ```

The SSM observer shares one deadline across its API queries and polling.
Expiry reports the remote exit as unconfirmed; a late terminal reply cannot
turn an expired observation into a successful run.

`run-all.ps1` exports `AIDLC_BUN_BIN` and
`AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1` before invoking `bun tests/run-tests.ts --all --debug -P <N>`.
Its preflight calls the shared `selectedTuiBackend` and `tuiUnavailableReason`
helpers through Bun to check the selected backend's prerequisites. Node
remains a full-suite tooling prerequisite. Live opt-in
does not establish coverage when a prerequisite check skips a journey:
inspect the captured per-file results. The script probes the Claude binary
across `C:\Users\Administrator\.local\bin` and the systemprofile home, since
the native installer drops `claude.exe` under whichever user ran the
CloudFormation UserData bootstrap (Administrator under EC2Launch v2).

The stack defaults to **`c5.4xlarge`** for the full `--all -P 8` live run.
Smaller hosts increase contention under parallel load; use a lighter tier
selection when reducing `InstanceType`. The shared timeout backstops above
allow for runner variation without treating one host's observed duration as a
performance requirement.

## Terminal Driver

`tests/harness/tui-drive.ts` drives an interactive CLI through named sessions.
The shared selector in `tests/harness/tui-runtime.ts` chooses its backend from
`AIDLC_TUI_BACKEND`:

| Selection | Platform and prerequisites |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Unset or `auto` | Native `bun` on Linux, Windows and macOS. |
| `bun` | Linux, Windows and macOS. Requires **Bun >=1.3.14**, `Bun.Terminal`, `bun:ffi`, and `@xterm/headless`. Native containment supports x64/arm64: Linux requires glibc, procfs, and kernel >=5.4 for pidfd signaling and waiting; Windows requires ConPTY; macOS uses libSystem process identities and inherited ownership tokens (see [Cross-Platform Coverage](#cross-platform-coverage) for its environment-scrubbing limitation). |
| `tmux` | Explicit alternative on Linux/macOS. Requires Bun to run the driver and `tmux` on `PATH`. |

`auto` chooses by platform; it does not fall back to another backend when
prerequisites are missing. Unknown values, including an empty string, are
configuration errors. `AIDLC_BUN_BIN` overrides the Bun executable for the
`bun` and `tmux` backends. Keep the same backend selection across commands for
a session. The native Bun backend does not require tmux.

The native daemon in `tests/harness/tui-bun-backend.ts` uses inline
`terminal: { ... }` options on `Bun.spawn` to own the PTY and its output
callbacks. `tests/harness/tui-screen.ts` parses those bytes through
`@xterm/headless` and returns emulator replies to the PTY. Commands reach the
daemon over a local socket on Linux or a named pipe on Windows, so the PTY
and screen survive separate driver invocations.

Each native session has its own daemon, PTY, screen, and authenticated IPC
endpoint. Give parallel workers distinct session names, projects, and
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profiles. The test runner must cap Bedrock concurrency
independently of the number of terminal sessions.

`tests/harness/tui-bun-process.ts` supervises descendants with Linux subreaper
and pidfd ownership, or a Windows Job Object. `kill` waits for confirmed
process cleanup and daemon retirement; `wait-dead` checks the daemon's
process identity. Start locks are owned by the OS and release when an
interrupted starter exits. Fixture cleanup also refuses to remove a project
while its native session has unconfirmed cleanup.

Session records and final snapshots remain under `AIDLC_TUI_BUN_ROOT`
(default: `$TMPDIR/aidlc-bun-tui`, using the OS temporary directory). Both
the default and an explicit root must be private: a real directory owned by
the current user with mode **0700** on POSIX, or on Windows a current-user
owner SID and no allow ACEs for Everyone, BUILTIN\Users or Authenticated Users.
Symlinks, junctions and other Windows reparse points are refused. The driver
creates a missing root with private permissions; it refuses an unsafe existing
root rather than changing its permissions. On POSIX, every explicit-root ancestor
must be owned by the current user or root, with no group/other write bits unless
sticky; the implicit root's temporary parent must be current-user-owned or mode
**1777**. On a controlled test host whose filesystem reports those ancestors as
owned by a sandbox uid (for example an overlay filesystem where `/` belongs to
`nobody`), set `AIDLC_TUI_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_ANCESTORS=1` to skip only the ownership
requirement; the write-bit rule and every other check here stay enforced.
Windows validates root/session owner and DACL, but does not yet validate
ancestor ACL trust; the generation handshake below remains enforced. Remove an
unsafe pre-created root or point `AIDLC_TUI_BUN_ROOT` at a private directory under
trusted ancestors, and keep that setting consistent across commands.

The test runner gives each file a separate private native root under a trusted
OS temporary directory, independent of log-directory permissions. After confirmed
transport cleanup it archives session records and snapshots in the file's
`tui-bun/` artifacts and removes the temporary native root; uncertain cleanup
retains the live namespace for diagnosis.

Launch records are private regular files pinned to the root and session
directories' filesystem identities. Both clients and the daemon validate
ownership, permissions and session identity before trusting them. The daemon
also requires a **starting** record with the fresh generation supplied by the
starter through argv, before creating a PTY or supervisor, and rechecks both
recorded directory identities immediately before releasing the command. Replayed
completed records cannot authorize a command; diagnostics are never written into
an untrusted directory.

Target exit status and PTY exit status are separate: Bun reports ordinary
Linux slave-close EIO as PTY status `1`. The driver accepts that status after
confirmed supervisor exit and cleanup; Bun's callback does not expose an errno
to distinguish other POSIX read errors.
Unreachable sessions and unconfirmed cleanup remain errors.

Captures read the current active viewport after queued output has been
parsed. Plain text joins soft-wrapped rows and trims trailing blank lines;
ANSI capture is reconstructed from the current cells and their attributes,
including palette and RGB colors. Scrollback and previously erased output
are excluded. JSON retains the full physical grid, including blank cells and
width-zero continuation cells for wide characters.

The existing `start`, `send`, plain `capture`, `startup`, and `wait` commands
retain their calling conventions. `send --keys "<text>" --literal` sends
literal text; without `--literal`, named keys are interpreted and arbitrary
text such as `1`/`2` remains literal. Enter is appended unless `--no-enter` is
set. `wait --stable-ms N` retains its screen-stability condition, and
`startup --ready-pattern "<regex>"` retains its startup navigation behavior.

The Bun backend supports these capture and input commands:

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `resize --session <name> --width N --height N` | Resizes both the PTY and emulator: columns 2–500, rows 1–200, at most 40,000 cells. |
| `paste --session <name> --text "<text>"` | Pastes text with **no implicit Enter**. Uses bracketed-paste markers only when the application has enabled that mode. CRLF and lone LF become CR; existing lone CR is retained. |
| `capture --session <name> --physical` | Returns plain text with physical visible rows; preserves the default logical capture API. |
| `capture --session <name> --json` | Returns a coherent `TuiSnapshot` with full cell data. |
| `capture --session <name> --ansi` | Returns the current viewport with cell colors and styles as ANSI sequences. |

Menu detection always consumes physical rows. Bun derives these from snapshot cells without changing `text`, wrap flags, or ANSI; tmux omits `-J` for these reads. This prevents ConPTY wrap metadata from joining visible menu options onto preceding rows. External automation can select `capture --physical`, separately from `--json` and `--ansi`.

`wait --pattern` and `startup --ready-pattern` default to `--view auto`: physical text is tried first, with logical text from the same frame as fallback. This preserves literal patterns spanning a genuine soft wrap while supporting row-anchored UI patterns. Use `--view physical` or `--view logical` to select one interpretation. Bun obtains both from one snapshot; tmux captures both in a single synchronous command list. Menu actions always inspect the physical view, regardless of pattern-view selection. Stability is measured on the matched view without restarting the overall deadline.

Live waits end on what the screen shows, not only on the clock. Once a wait has seen the agent working (its status spinner and elapsed timer, a background-agent wait, a running subagent row, or a running command's background hint) and Claude's empty prompt then stays unchanged for 30 seconds, the turn has ended: `wait` fails with the last pane if its pattern never painted, `answer-gate` fails if no menu appeared and its terminator is unmet, and revision recovery types free-text feedback only at that idle prompt. A screen the driver does not recognize counts as working, so the hang backstop still applies. Across recorded sessions the longest idle-looking pause inside a turn was under half a second. `wait --through-turn-end` keeps waiting past the end of a turn. `answer-gate` answers a menu only once its rows, from its highlighted option through its footer, read the same across half a second, so a menu caught mid-paint is not answered by its first half; rows still changing after five seconds send it back to waiting for a menu. After it answers a menu, it waits up to five seconds while that menu's rows, from its highlighted option through its footer, stay unchanged apart from the caret and checkbox marks its own keys move, so a slow or partial repaint is not answered twice; it stops waiting when those rows repaint or its terminator lands (with `--stop-at-approval-gate`, only a repaint ends it), and a menu still intact after five seconds is answered again.

`resize`, `paste`, and `capture --json` require the Bun backend. ANSI capture
is also available with tmux. `--json` and `--ansi` are mutually exclusive.

Invoke these through the same driver, for example:

```bash
bun tests/harness/tui-drive.ts resize --session demo --width 120 --height 40
bun tests/harness/tui-drive.ts paste --session demo --text "draft input"
bun tests/harness/tui-drive.ts capture --session demo --json
```

`TuiSnapshot` is defined in `tests/harness/tui-screen.ts`: it contains
`sequence`, `cols`, `rows`, zero-based `cursor: { x, y }`, `buffer`
(`normal` or `alternate`), `text`, `ansi`, and `lines`. Each line has a
`wrapped` flag and a `cells` array. Each cell carries `chars`, `width`,
`fg`/`bg` colors (`mode: default|palette|rgb`, numeric `value`), and boolean
`bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`, `inverse`, `invisible`, and
`strikethrough` attributes. The sequence advances after parsed output or a
resize; an unchanged capture does not advance it. Cursor `x` can equal
`cols` when a wrap is pending.

The unit suites `tests/unit/t-tui-runtime.test.ts` and
`tests/unit/t-tui-screen.test.ts` define deterministic checks for runtime
selection and terminal transcripts. The screen suite includes UTF-8
regressions for:

- The exact 85-byte ANSI/Unicode preflight payload at all 86 two-chunk split positions, including empty edge chunks.
- Every fixed chunk size from 1 through 85 bytes, with a parser drain between writes; text, physical cells, widths, colors, and ANSI must agree.
- All byte partitions of selected 2-, 3-, and 4-byte characters containing `0x80` continuation bytes.
- Incomplete UTF-8 retained across `flush()` calls until the remaining bytes arrive.
- Malformed UTF-8 rendered as `U+FFFD` replacement cells instead of silently disappearing.

The screen uses an incremental `StringDecoder` before xterm's string API:
xterm 5.5's byte decoder can lose a character when a saved continuation byte
is `0x80`, as in a fragmented em dash (`E2 80 94`).

`tests/unit/t-tui-bun-process-linux.test.ts` exercises real Linux supervision;
`tests/integration/t-tui-bun-lifecycle.test.ts` covers Windows Job Object,
signal, and descendant cleanup. `tests/unit/t-tui-process-identity.test.ts`
covers identities and lock release, including interrupted starters.
`tests/integration/t-tui-bun-backend.test.ts` runs the public CLI against
token-free targets, including eight simultaneous sessions, input, ANSI/cell
capture, resizing, paste, restart, IPC errors, and daemon retirement.

The TUI preflight calibrates the selected backend. Native lifecycle has the
separate coverage above. Live model journeys retain their existing opt-ins.
Keep temporary Claude fixtures outside repository ancestors so they do not
inherit development instructions or external-import prompts.

## Preflight Validation

Before running unfiltered live-capable levels (integration or e2e), the runner executes `tests/integration/t19.test.ts` as a gate. It drives a tiny real turn through the **Claude Agent SDK** (the same live path the integration tier uses) and asserts only on deterministic surfaces. A skipped preflight closes the Claude gate without failing a default run; `AIDLC_CLAUDE_SDK_LIVE=1`, `AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1`, or `--require-coverage` instead requires complete, non-skipped passing evidence. An actual preflight failure, timeout, or cleanup error fails the run in every mode. Whether the preflight skips or fails, deterministic files still run and Claude-dependent files receive per-file `SKIP` entries.

The SDK driver gives each `driveAidlc()` call an ephemeral `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
and disables session persistence. Live tests therefore leave the user's
`~/.claude.json` and Claude transcripts untouched, including when the home
directory is read-only inside a command sandbox. A per-call
`env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` remains available for focused calibration.

A drive is one session and, by default, ends at its first turn's result. A
journey that needs the person's next message passes `nextMessage`: when a turn
ends, it gets the turn number and the drive's running totals so far (pickers,
tool results, Stop hooks; subtract the previous turn's totals for one turn's
own) and returns the message to send into the same session (or nothing, to end
the drive). `chatAboutQuestionWhen` answers a picker the way Claude Code's
"Chat about this" button does, so the question stays open; an `answerScript`
spec `{ text }` types the person's own words into a picker; `captureStopHooks`
records each Stop hook verdict with its turn. `stopWhen` ends the drive once
the tool results so far satisfy it, for a stop that needs more than one result
(an engine line that can arrive before or after the step that creates the
work).

A suite launched from inside a Claude Code session (`CLAUDECODE=1`) does not
hand that session's `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` defaults to its drives: the
SDK's bundled Claude Code may be older than the session's model and refuse it.
When a drive's final provider is Bedrock, it gets CI's pinned models
(`CI_BEDROCK_MODELS` in `scripts/ci-credential-broker.ts`) for any model the
project settings or the test did not set; otherwise the bundled defaults. A run
from any other shell, CI's included, keeps its environment unchanged.

| Assertion | Surface | On fail |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| AWS credentials valid | `aws sts get-caller-identity` exits 0 (PASS-by-skip when the `aws` CLI is absent) | bail — Bedrock needs IAM auth |
| Live turn reaches a terminal result | the SDK run produces a non-`undefined` `resultEvent` (the binary the tier needs is present and reachable) | bail — substrate/API unreachable |
| Turn completes without error | `resultEvent.is_error === false` (the deterministic equal of `claude -p` exit 0; a 124/137 hang leaves it undefined) | bail — API unresponsive |
| Response is non-empty | the run captured *some* output — a `tool_result` or assistant text (presence, never content) | bail — API produced nothing |

A red here is a real environment finding (missing `claude`, expired creds), never a flake to soften — exactly the gate's job of bailing the downstream LLM tiers fast.

## Test Registry

The suite is **discovered, not registered**: `bun tests/run-tests.ts` walks the
four level directories (`tests/{smoke,unit,integration,e2e}/`) and runs every
`t*.test.ts` it finds. There is no hand-maintained per-test table to keep in
sync — adding a test file is all it takes for the runner to pick it up.

What each test *covers* is tracked mechanically by
`tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts`, from the `covers:` header in a test file's
leading comment block (typically line 1; a few files legitimately declare none
and simply contribute no coverage claim). The generator enumerates the framework's units across seven
classes (`function`, `audit`, `scope`, `stage`, `hook`, `subcommand`,
`render-surface`), maps each `covers:` claim onto an enumerated unit, and builds
one entry per unit with its claims and status.

The registry is **never committed**. A committed copy changed in nearly every
PR, so queued PRs collided on it or had to regenerate it after each rebase. CI
builds it fresh instead: the **Coverage ratchet** job, part of the required
`Tests (smoke + unit)` check, runs `--check --base HEAD^1`. That builds the
registry for the commit under test and for its first parent (the PR's base, or
the queue entry ahead), the parent with its own packager and generator in a
temp directory, and fails naming each unit the parent covers that the commit
still has but no longer covers. Coverage can only grow: a new unit with no
claim is listed but never fails, and a unit whose code was deleted or renamed
is no loss. To keep a unit covered when its test goes away, add its `covers:`
claim to another test that exercises it.

```bash
bun tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts                             # write tests/.coverage-registry.json locally (gitignored)
bun tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts --check                     # the anti-rot guards on a fresh build
bun tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts --check --base origin/main  # and fail if a unit main covers lost its claim
```

The generator reads the units from the packaged `dist/claude` tree. If that
tree was packaged from other sources (`core/`, `harness/`, `plugins/` or the
packager's own scripts) than the checkout, both commands refuse with one line:
run `bun scripts/package.ts` first. `package.ts` records a content fingerprint of its inputs per harness in
`dist/.package-sources.json` (`scripts/package-sources.ts`), so undoing an edit
needs no rebuild. A build during which an input changed is not recorded and
fails, saying to run it again. Temp trees from the generator's `AIDLC_COVERAGE_*` seams have
no `core/` and are not checked.

To find which test exercises a given function, audit event, scope, stage,
hook, subcommand, or render surface, write the registry locally and read it, or
grep the `covers:` headers directly. The unit tier runs `--check` on every tree,
so a broken enumerator reds the gate.

> **Note:** t19 appears in both unit (`tests/unit/t19.test.ts`, the jump CLI
> tool) and integration (`tests/integration/t19.test.ts`, the live preflight
> gate) — a level/file path, not a bare ID, disambiguates such collisions.

## Trigger Points

| Trigger | Layer | Command | Where |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| `git commit` | L1 | `bun tests/run-tests.ts` | Local (pre-commit hook) |
| Pull request push | Fast deterministic gate | `ci.yml`: contract checks + Linux smoke, twelve unit shards and deterministic integration (the scope runs and the guard matrix in jobs of their own), using `deterministic-tests.yml`, plus production-guard checks; the cross-OS native-terminal and live OS-isolation jobs are skipped | GitHub Actions |
| Merge queue (`merge_group`) | Full deterministic gate | `ci.yml` reruns the pull-request gate on the queued merge commit on Linux, macOS and Windows (the scope runs and the guard matrix on Linux only; on macOS the unit tier runs only the unit files that name macOS and the ones the change touches, in two jobs instead of twelve shards), adding isolated E2E on each, retrying an assertion-failed smoke, unit or integration file once with a `Flaky test` warning, and adds the native-terminal units (Linux arm64, macOS, Windows) and live OS-isolation checks (Linux, macOS, Windows), plus three advisory Windows lanes: the documented `install.ps1` one-liner under Windows PowerShell 5.1 against a release candidate staged from the same commit, the hook contracts with Git Bash removed from `PATH`, and the smoke tier plus a compiled binary installed with the documented `install.sh` inside WSL 1 | GitHub Actions |
| Manual deterministic workflow dispatch | Targeted deterministic reproduction | `deterministic-tests.yml` accepts an immutable source SHA, runner, tier, required N/M shard for unit and optional manual-only `diagnostic_filter`; non-unit tiers omit the shard; one runner executes with model gates closed | GitHub Actions |
| Manual CI dispatch with `platform_regressions=true` | Expanded deterministic matrix | `ci.yml` selects Linux/macOS/Windows smoke, twelve unit shards, integration and isolated E2E as separate jobs in the shared workflow, with the scope runs and the guard matrix on Linux | GitHub Actions |
| Nightly preview / manual preview dispatch | Declared nightly matrix | `preview-release.yml` calls `full-suite.yml` even for an unchanged source, running native obligations, release contracts, bounded hosted live shards, and the scope runs and the guard matrix on Linux, macOS and Windows | GitHub Actions |
| Explicit manual Full Suite with `full_verification=true` | Credential-free candidate verification | Runs every job that receives no OIDC or AWS credentials for the selected workflow head, including an unmerged PR; live lanes need `live_verification`; separate evidence is not consumed by stable publication | GitHub Actions |
| Explicit manual Full Suite with `live_verification=true` | Candidate live verification | Runs live preparation and hosted live/release-contract jobs for the selected workflow head only; separate evidence is not consumed by stable publication | GitHub Actions |
| Stable tag | Exact-source release validation | `release.yml` validates the tag and source, reuses a passing release-purpose `full-suite-result` for the exact tagged commit or calls `full-suite.yml` for it, and runs contract checks, builds, and native/installer/lifecycle validation alongside; `publish` and `release` require the passing Full Suite | GitHub Actions |

L1 can be enforced via a git pre-commit hook: `bun tests/run-tests.ts || exit 1`.

When the merge queue drops a PR only because a GitHub-hosted runner failed,
`merge-queue-notice.yml` posts one comment on the PR saying so, naming the jobs,
and noting that a maintainer can add it back. It runs on `workflow_run` after each
merge-queue CI run, checks out only the default branch, and uses the built-in
token with `actions: read`, `checks: read`, `contents: read` and
`pull-requests: write`. `.github/scripts/merge-queue-notice.ts` owns the
signatures, read from GitHub's records:

- for a `failed_checks` removal, every red job either lost its runner ("The
  hosted runner lost communication with the server", no failed step) or failed
  checkout with "Could not resolve host: github.com";
- for a `checks_timed_out` removal, every job still open at the removal was
  either waiting for a runner or still in "Prepare unit test substrates".

It posts nothing for test failures, conflicts, manual removals, PRs that change
`.github/`, PRs already back in the queue, or a run it already explained, and
it never enqueues, dequeues or merges. `t-ci-merge-queue-notice` pins this on
trimmed records of real drops in `tests/fixtures/merge-queue-notice/`.

PR CI stays strict: a failing file is red on the PR, with no retry, so a flake
is seen where it was introduced. The merge queue is different, because one
flaky file drops the PR and rebuilds every group queued behind it. There,
`ci.yml` passes `retry-once` to the smoke, unit and integration legs, which run
the tier with `--file-retries 1`: a file whose first attempt failed assertions
(failed cases, complete JUnit evidence, no file timeout, no cleanup failure, at
most ten minutes, and at least five minutes left in the run) runs once more in a
fresh process and temporary directory. A case that ran past its own case timeout
is a failed case, and a file whose only failures are such case timeouts (a slow
Windows runner timing out cases) may have run up to 45 minutes and
still gets its one retry; `retries.json` marks it `caseTimeoutsOnly`. The rule lives in
`tests/lib/file-retry.ts`, shared with the isolated live retry. A crash or
nonzero exit without failed cases, a file that executed no cases, a file that
ran past its deadline, and a second failure are never retried. Only a retry that passes every case the
first attempt ran replaces the first failure: a second failure, or a retry that
skips one of those cases or executes none, stays a failure.
The retry starts only after the first attempt's evidence is moved aside whole;
if any of it cannot be, the file is not retried.
A pass on the second attempt is never silent: the job shows a `Flaky test`
warning ("<file> passed on its second attempt (merge queue)"), the step summary
lists it under "Passed on retry", the file's `summary.txt` row keeps `PASS`
with a "passed on retry" line under it, and `retries.json` in the run's log
directory records every retry for flake triage. The first attempt's log and
JUnit stay beside the second as `<file>.attempt-1.*`. Isolated e2e and Full
Suite never take the flag. `t-runner-production-guards` and
`t-ci-retry-report` cover the rule, the runner and the report.

macOS runners are the slowest and fewest hosted runners, so they set the merge
queue's pace: a full macOS unit set costs about 245 job-minutes per merge group.
In the queue only, `ci.yml` passes `macos-merge-selection` to the macOS unit
shards, and `scripts/ci-macos-unit-selection.ts` picks the unit files whose
source names macOS or darwin (computed on each run, never a kept list) plus the
unit files the change touches against its first parent (the queue entry ahead),
spread over the twelve shards by weight, about 60 job-minutes in all. A selected
file brings the rest of its affinity group (t249 reads the binary t238 builds).
Each shard runs its share as one whole shard (`--shard 1/1`, so the shard rules
such as required compiled coverage hold) and leaves the other files out with
`--exclude`, so a file that skips on macOS stays `SKIP` as in a full shard; a
shard with no selected file stops before installing. When the change cannot be
diffed, a selected name falls outside the test-file grammar, or the selection
fails, the shard runs in full.
macOS smoke, integration, isolated E2E and the native-terminal units, Linux and
Windows, PR CI and the nightly Full Suite run every file. `t345` pins this.

`main` is not production: PR CI and the merge queue remain the fast gates listed
above, while required hosted live tiers run in
`full-suite.yml`. `preview-release.yml` dispatches it every night as a separate
run for the preview source SHA. Its failures remain visible in that run and in
the preview notes, without failing the preview workflow. By maintainer decision on 2026-09-26, which reverses the
2026-09-21 decision that stable releases need no Full Suite result, a stable
release publishes only after a release-purpose Full Suite passed for the exact
tagged commit.

Create the stable tag only after the release-preparation commit has passed its
required branch checks. The tag workflow's `Find Full Suite evidence` job looks
for a passing `full-suite-result` for the tagged commit from a successful
Preview Release run of that commit or a successful manual `full-suite.yml`
dispatch on `main` with `ref=<sha>`, and reuses the first that qualifies.
Otherwise `release.yml` calls `full-suite.yml` for the tagged commit, which adds
the suite's hours to the release. Builds and lifecycle checks run alongside it;
`Require a passing Full Suite` gates `publish` and `release`. A tag outside
`main` fails validation, because a release-purpose Full Suite only tests commits
already on `main`. To keep the suite out of the release run, let the nightly
preview build the release commit first, or dispatch `full-suite.yml` on `main`
with `ref=<sha>`. A newer dispatch on the same workflow ref
with the same verification selection cancels the older run, so redispatching
live verification after a push supersedes the run for the previous head.
Release-purpose dispatches also key on the `ref` input, and Full Suite runs
called by the preview are never cancelled this way.

`ci.yml` and `full-suite.yml` call the same reusable
`.github/workflows/deterministic-tests.yml`. Callers select the immutable `ref`,
runner, tier, unit shard, an optional file `filter` and `exclude` (both empty
by default, so the whole tier runs) and artifact label. Both split integration
in three jobs: the scope runs (`filter`, `t-scope-run-*`), the guard matrix
(`filter`, `t-guard-matrix-*`) and everything else (`exclude` of both). PR CI
selects Linux smoke, twelve weighted unit shards, and the three integration
jobs; a `full_verification` Full Suite selects smoke, the same twelve shards,
the three integration jobs, and isolated E2E on Linux/macOS/Windows. The
nightly Full Suite runs no deterministic tier; its `scope_runs` job calls the
shared workflow for the scope runs and the guard matrix on all three. Integration and
E2E run as independent jobs per OS, each with a fresh Bun runner process.
Every call owns a fresh checkout, installs frozen dependencies under Bun 1.4.2,
regenerates projections, and invokes the Bash wrapper with `--debug -P 8
--no-llm`. E2E runs retain `--isolated-e2e`; smoke and unit remain serial within
each checkout. Sharing the workflow shares the commands and setup, not previous
test results.

Deterministic, native-terminal, and production-guard test jobs use a five-hour
job backstop and a 270-minute execution step. The runner shares a four-hour
work deadline across the invocation, with a two-hour deadline per file,
including smoke and isolated deterministic E2E.
This hierarchy leaves time to retire processes, finish reports, sanitize logs
and upload evidence after work stops. Unit work remains partitioned into twelve
weighted shards per OS without duplication; compiled producer/consumer
affinity is preserved.

The same hierarchy applies to merge-queue native-terminal checks, Full Suite
native obligations and production-guard checks. These paths
must not quietly reintroduce a smaller case, file, run or step ceiling. They
all retain captured `--debug -P 8` wrapper execution and evidence collection.
Credentialed live jobs retain their separate one-hour credential boundary:
60-minute files within 70-minute steps and 80-minute jobs. Their nested driver
operations allocate from the remaining file budget.

For a focused deterministic reproduction, dispatch `deterministic-tests.yml`
directly on the candidate branch:

```bash
gh workflow run deterministic-tests.yml --ref '<candidate-branch>' \
  -f 'ref=<exact-source-sha>' -f runner=windows-latest -f tier=unit \
  -f unit-shard=1/1 -f 'diagnostic_filter=^t-tui-runtime$'
```

`diagnostic_filter` is a manual-only filename regex and is not exposed to
reusable CI callers. The unit tier requires `unit-shard=N/M`; `1/1` selects all
unit files before filtering. For smoke, integration or e2e, omit `unit-shard`;
its default is empty. For example, use `-f tier=integration` without a shard
input. Each reproduction uses one fresh runner with model gates closed and
the same immutable checkout, bounded runner and sanitized evidence paths.
The default artifact is
`ci-deterministic-probe-<OS>`. These targeted diagnostics do not qualify a full
suite or release.

POSIX unit jobs require tmux: the shared setup first checks `command -v`, then
uses apt on Linux or Homebrew on macOS only when it is missing. Linux unit jobs
also install zsh when absent. Missing tools fail setup rather than skipping the
compatibility cases.

The shared workflow binds the checked-out commit to the caller's SHA.
Release-purpose Full Suite runs authorize that SHA against `main` in the plan
job; manual verification instead binds it to the selected workflow head.
PR CI can test its PR merge commit without receiving live credentials.
Each run captures stdout/stderr in the checkout root's
`tmp/ci-deterministic/run.log`, prints that path and the actual log stamp, and
preserves both this capture and `tests/logs/` after successful sanitization.
Artifacts use the caller's label plus the actual runner OS and retain evidence
for 90 days. `ci.yml` passes `evidence-optional: true` because no workflow
downloads its `ci-deterministic-*` artifacts: a failed upload is reported on
the job but does not fail it, so an upload timeout cannot drop a PR whose tests
passed. The test step's own exit code still fails the job. CI's
`ci-native-*` and `production-guard-evidence` uploads follow the same rule.
Full Suite does not pass the input, so the `full-suite-deterministic-*`
uploads of a manual full verification run stay required: that run exists to
hand a person its evidence, and no queued PR waits on it.

For platform verification before a nightly fix lands, dispatch
`gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch> -f platform_regressions=true`. This expands
the existing deterministic matrix to all three OSes and adds isolated E2E jobs
alongside integration; it does not run the Linux pass first or append another broad
regression slice. The full unit shards include the tmux, path, workspace-fixture,
and macOS regressions, with t238/t249 kept in their weighted affinity group.
They use the same POSIX provisioning and capture path as nightly tests.
Focused native, production guard, and OS-isolation checks remain required.
Manual CI does not make model calls or produce a Full Suite result.

## How to Add a Stage Test

1. Choose the stage to test and identify what state fixture it needs (the state must show that stage as the current/next stage)
2. Create or reuse a state fixture in `tests/fixtures/`
3. Create `tests/integration/tNN-stage-SLUG.test.ts` and use the shared TypeScript harness helpers (`tests/harness/fixtures.ts`, `tests/harness/sdk-drive.ts`, `tests/harness/tui-drive.ts`, `tests/harness/plugin-kit.ts`, or `tests/harness/exec-drive.ts`) rather than shell TAP helpers.
4. Run with `bun tests/run-tests.ts --integration` or directly: `bun test tests/integration/tNN-stage-SLUG.test.ts`

## How to Add Acceptance Assertions

To add artifact assertions to an existing e2e workflow test under `tests/e2e/`:

1. Read the current test and understand what it already checks
2. Add `expect(...)` assertions inside the existing `test(...)` block (bun:test
   counts assertions from the calls themselves — there is no `plan` line to keep
   in sync)
3. Use flexible patterns: match `/[Tt]odo/` against `readFileSync` content, not
   exact strings
4. Use `test.skipIf(...)` / an early return for assertions that depend on
   non-deterministic LLM output format
5. Use `expect(statSync(path).size).toBeGreaterThan(minBytes)` for size-bound checks

## Assertion Design Principles

- **Keyword classes** — Use case-insensitive regex: `[Tt]odo`, `[Rr]eact`, `[Bb]rownfield`
- **Flexible discovery** — Use `find` + `wc -l` to count files rather than checking exact names
- **Size bounds** — Use `statSync(path).size` with `toBeGreaterThan()` for minimum content
- **Graceful degradation** — Use `skip` when an assertion depends on non-deterministic LLM output
- **Structure over content** — Check for markdown headings (`^#`), file existence, directory creation before checking content

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AIDLC_TEST_TIMEOUT` | `1800` | Per-`claude -p` call timeout in seconds. `0` disables that operation timer; file/run deadlines still apply. |
| `AIDLC_TUI_BACKEND` | `auto` | Terminal driver: native `bun` on Linux/Windows/macOS. Explicit values: `bun`, `tmux`; see [Terminal Driver](#terminal-driver). |
| `AIDLC_TUI_BUN_ROOT` | `<os.tmpdir()>/aidlc-bun-tui` | Native records/snapshots; use the same root across commands. Must be user-owned and private (0700 on POSIX; current-user owner, no Everyone/Users/Authenticated Users allow ACEs on Windows), never a symlink/reparse point. A missing root is created privately; an unsafe existing root or identity-replaced session directory is refused. |
| `AIDLC_TUI_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_ANCESTORS` | unset | Set to `1` only on a controlled test host whose temporary-directory ancestors are owned by a sandbox uid (neither root nor the current user), such as an overlay filesystem where `/` belongs to `nobody`. Without it, every live native-root tier fails at setup, and the error names this variable. It skips only the POSIX explicit-root ancestor ownership check: ancestors writable by other users without the sticky bit and symlink/reparse points are still refused, and the private root's owner, mode and generation handshake stay enforced. |
| `AIDLC_BUN_BIN` | current Bun executable, otherwise `bun` on `PATH` | Executable override for the Bun and tmux TUI backends. Native PTY use on Linux/Windows/macOS requires Bun >=1.3.14. |
| `AIDLC_NODE_BIN` | unset | Node executable made available to isolated live tool environments and test fixtures; it does not select a TUI backend. |
| `AIDLC_TEST_GUARD_PROFILE` | `fixture` (runner-set) | Runner-provided diagnostic for tests: `fixture` or `production`, selected by the runner CLI. An inherited value does not select the profile; the runner replaces it in every test child. |
| `AIDLC_TEST_COMPILED_DIR` | `<runner log dir>/compiled` (runner-set) | Run-owned handoff from t238 to t249: the verified native `aidlc` / `aidlc.exe` plus adjacent `runtime/`. The runner replaces inherited values in every child, keeping the artifact outside per-file temp cleanup and isolated from other runs. |
| `AIDLC_TEST_COMPILED_EXECUTABLE` | unset | Optional existing executable for direct, non-sharded t249 invocations without a runner handoff. Never a build destination; it cannot replace a missing sharded handoff. |
| `AIDLC_TUI_SETTING_SOURCES` | `project` | Setting sources injected into live `claude` TUI launches. Use `default` or an empty value only for focused calibration that intentionally includes user/local Claude settings. |
| `AIDLC_TUI_TRACE_POLL_MS` | `10000` | Minimum interval between `answer_gate_poll` snapshots in TUI NDJSON traces while a long journey is waiting for the next menu or disk terminator. |
| `AIDLC_ACP_DIAGNOSTIC_TRACE` | unset | Set to `1` with ACP debug tracing to write a private `<trace>.protocol.ndjson` sidecar containing tool input/chunk events, session/turn identity, cancellation requests and aggregate input shapes. Excludes agent-prose events, prompt/auth RPC bodies and process environment. Tool inputs remain private diagnostic data. Limits: 1 MiB per event and 64 MiB per file; `diagnostic_incomplete` or `json_parse_error` means the capture cannot establish complete protocol evidence. |
| `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_LIVE` | unset | Set to `1` to run the signed-in Kiro IDE desktop journey on macOS or Windows. |
| `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_BIN` | platform default | Override the Kiro IDE executable. Defaults to `/Applications/Kiro.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron` on macOS and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Kiro\Kiro.exe` on Windows. |
| `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_SEED` | generated seed | Optional Kiro user-data directory. The test copies it to a disposable temp directory before launch and never mutates the source profile. |
| `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_DIAGNOSTICS` | unset | Optional per-file NDJSON diagnostic path. Includes up to 64 lifecycle records per IDE launch: owned PID, timestamps, browser-close protocol events, child exit/close and fallback signals. Records exclude endpoints, profile contents, raw error text and environment values; diagnostic I/O failures do not replace test failures. |

```

`--no-llm` (or `AIDLC_NO_LLM=1`) closes the derived Claude gate and forces every
live-model opt-in to `0`: Claude TUI, Kiro ACP/TUI/IDE, Codex exec, and opencode
run. Deterministic tests in those tiers still run, including the token-free TUI
substrate preflight. This gives CI a full-tier deterministic profile without
live-model cost or flakiness, even when CLIs are installed and live variables
were inherited as `1`.

Live SDK and TUI harness drivers default to project-only Claude setting sources.
That means they load the copied test `.claude/` project settings and hooks while
excluding developer user-level hooks/settings. This mirrors the installed
framework surface and prevents local interactive preferences from changing test
behavior; explicit driver options or `AIDLC_TUI_SETTING_SOURCES` remain the
escape hatch for calibration.

`--all --debug` (and `--release --debug`) defaults `AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1` unless the
environment already set it. This makes the "everything with traces" profile run
the live, token-spending TUI journeys by default; set `AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=0`
explicitly to keep those files on their in-test SKIP path.

`--exclude` matches the same names but selects nothing: the files it matches
are left out of the tier, and the rest keep their ordinary, unfiltered rules
below. With `--shard`, the shard is chosen first and then the files it matches
are left out of it.

The scope runs and the guard matrix (`t-scope-run-*`, `t-guard-matrix-*`) take
minutes per file, so a run with no `--filter` leaves them out and says so; the
full `--release` and `--all` acceptance keeps them. Run them alone with
`--integration -P 8 --filter '^t-(scope-run|guard-matrix)-'`, as their CI jobs
do.

An explicit **`--filter` requires execution in each selected file**. A file
whose cases are all skipped (or which declares no cases) fails the run even
when another selected file passes. A partially skipped file still passes if
at least one case executes successfully; `expect()` counts are not the
execution signal. An unmatched filter also fails, retaining `Test files: 0`
and an explanation in `failures.txt` rather than inventing a failed test.

Unfiltered suites preserve optional skips, reporting all-skipped files as
`SKIP`. `--no-llm` (or `AIDLC_NO_LLM=1`) still deliberately excludes
Claude-dependent files from mixed selections. If an explicit filter selects
only those excluded files, the run fails because no cases executed. Without
`--no-llm`, an explicitly selected Claude file fails when its substrate is
unavailable. Other explicitly filtered live files that report all cases
skipped also fail: enable their documented live variable and provide the
required CLI/authentication. A live opt-in alone is not execution evidence.

The summary and per-file logs report executed and skipped test-case counts
separately from the historical `Total assertions` field (which counts JUnit
test cases, including skips). `--verbose` / `--debug` retains Bun's
`<test-name>.junit.xml` next to the per-file log when Bun emits it.
Coverage failures name the file and remedy in `summary.txt` and
`failures.txt`; no assertion failure is invented for a skipped case.

## Guard Profiles

The default **fixture** profile keeps synthetic test setup convenient: it sets
`AIDLC_SKIP_ARTIFACT_GUARD`, `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD`,
`AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD`, `AIDLC_SKIP_REVISION_BACKSTOP`, and
`AIDLC_ALLOW_DIRECT_AUDIT_EVENTS` to `1` in test children. Other inherited
variables retain their existing behavior.

Use **`--production-guards` with `--filter`** for tests that provide real guard
evidence and exercise the owning commands or hooks. It applies to every test
selected by the invocation and does not change tier selection or live-model
gates. For example, exercise the runner's own profile contract:

```bash
bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 --unit --production-guards \
  --filter '^t-runner-production-guards'
```

Production children receive `0` for the known guard skips, direct audit/state
authority switches, and recordable bypasses, including ensemble evidence,
plan approval, reviewer scope, review freeze, and usage tracking. Any inherited
`AIDLC_SKIP_*`, `AIDLC_DISABLE_*`, or `AIDLC_ALLOW_DIRECT_*` variable is also
forced to `0`. This happens after the runner loads `.claude/settings.json`
environment values, so a shell or project-settings off-switch cannot silently
change the child's initial guard profile. Explicit zeroes on recordable bypasses
also take precedence over `aidlc.settings.json` / `aidlc.settings.local.json`
bypass lists; simply deleting the variables would allow that fallback.

The runner prints `Guard profile: fixture (...)` or
`Guard profile: production (...)` at startup and in the stdout summary, and
writes the same label into `summary.txt` and per-file logs under `--verbose`
or `--debug`. Tests can assert
`process.env.AIDLC_TEST_GUARD_PROFILE === "production"` before exercising a
guard; an inherited marker never selects the profile.

This is a child-launch environment contract. Test code and harness helpers can
still override their own environment, write settings, or construct synthetic
fixtures. In particular, `resetAidlcEnv()` only deletes
`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` and `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS`; it preserves the
profile marker and other guard settings, and does not restore production
zeroes after a test changes them. A production-profile label alone is not proof
that an individual test used production guard evidence. Review the selected
test's environment overrides and setup as part of that claim.

The PR workflow's `test_guards` job (`Tests (production guards)`) runs the
deterministic runner and recovery contracts with production guards enabled:

```bash
bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 --production-guards --unit --integration \
  --no-llm --filter '^(t-runner-production-guards|t-guard-recovery-production)' \
  > "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/tmp/ci-guard-contract/production-run.log" 2>&1
```

The job creates that log directory and always uploads its logs and `tests/logs/`
as `production-guard-evidence`; a failed upload does not fail the job. The existing `test` aggregate (`Tests (smoke +
unit)`, retained as the required-check name) requires `test_guards` to succeed
alongside smoke, every unit shard, and deterministic integration on every
trigger, plus the native-terminal and live OS-isolation matrices outside PR
pushes. The production-guard slice runs on every PR push; both cross-OS matrices
join it in the merge queue.

Dropping `--production-guards` from this filtered command fails because
`t-guard-recovery-production.test.ts` executes no journeys under the fixture
profile. Passing runner unit tests cannot mask that missing coverage.
The unfiltered deterministic integration jobs in the preview's `full-suite.yml` keep
their deliberate fixture profile and report the production journey file as
`SKIP`; the required production jobs in PR CI and Full Suite exercise those
journeys. Full Suite additionally requires complete coverage for that selection.

## Parallel Execution

`--parallel N` (or `-P N`) runs up to N test files concurrently within a tier. Default is serial (`1`).

**When it helps.** Live integration and e2e tests spend much of their wall-clock time on CLI startup and model turns. Integration helpers create a fresh project for each test. E2E families with shared profiles or generated outputs additionally need the isolated checkout mode described below.

**Spike results (2026-05-06, Opus 4.7 via Bedrock):**

| Scenario | Serial | `--parallel 4` | `--parallel 8` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 × `/aidlc --help` | 56s | 16s (3.5x) | — |
| 8 × `/aidlc --help` | — | — | 31s |

All 8 parallel calls observed `cache_read=73789`. This historical help-command probe observed prompt-cache reuse without throttling or corruption; it does not establish capacity for concurrent full workflows.

**What stays serial.** Smoke and unit tiers ignore `--parallel` and run serially within one checkout. Unit CI reduces wall-clock time with isolated shards instead: each shared-workflow call owns a fresh checkout and runs its assigned files serially, so packaging tests can regenerate `dist/` without racing readers. PR CI uses twelve weighted unit shards on Linux and eight workers for integration, which start the longest integration files first. Manual Full Suite `full_verification` uses the same shard definition on Linux, macOS, and Windows; smoke runs once per OS, and deterministic integration and isolated E2E run in separate jobs with eight workers each. Adding `-P 8` to a combined smoke/unit command alone does not parallelize those tiers. The preflight gate (`tests/integration/t19.test.ts`) also runs serially because the LLM tiers depend on its exit status.

**Output under parallelism.** `START` markers stream live; several can appear before the first `DONE`. In normal/verbose mode, the TypeScript coordinator buffers each test's TAP body and writes it as one block when that file finishes. In `--debug` mode, Bun stdout/stderr streams live while still being written to each per-test log; parallel debug output is prefixed by file basename so overlapping workers remain attributable. SDK/TUI/Kiro-ACP driver traces are written beside the logs as `$LOG_DIR/sdk-drive-*.ndjson`, `$LOG_DIR/tui-drive-*.ndjson`, and `$LOG_DIR/kiro-acp-drive-*.ndjson`; isolated E2E places them under the file's artifact directory. The runner prints their paths at startup and at each test start. Kiro-ACP traces include tool calls and updates, output previews, permission answers, process stderr, and result/timeout/end events so a timeout can be investigated from retained evidence.

**Worker coordination.** The TypeScript runner starts one Bun test subprocess per file and tracks active promises. It waits for a file to finish before admitting another when the parallel limit is reached. Each completed file gets a `.meta` sidecar in `$LOG_DIR/_results/`; the runner reads those records to populate the summary tables. The shell wrapper delegates to this runner on every platform.

**Guidance.** For isolated E2E, use `-P 8` for checkout capacity and start with a small explicit provider limit such as `--bedrock-parallel 2`. Divide that provider allowance between simultaneous jobs and machines. Increase it only after measuring representative workflows for throttling, latency and failures. Use `--filter` to investigate an individual failure.

## Isolated E2E Workers

`--e2e --isolated-e2e` separates worker capacity from live-provider capacity.
`-P` controls the number of checkout workers. Known TUI, Codex exec, Kiro
ACP/IDE, and opencode serial files may run concurrently because each worker owns
its checkout, generated trees, application profile, temporary fixtures, terminal
namespace, and output directory. Unknown `.serial.` families retain exclusive
execution until their shared resources have been reviewed.

Temporary projects live outside Git checkouts so repository discovery cannot
inherit the runner's source tree. Failed fixtures are retained alongside the
logs after process cleanup. Fresh Claude profiles receive first-run preparation;
an owned startup model-upgrade offer is declined through its visible “No” choice
to preserve the shipped model pin.

Each file receives a private `AIDLC_TUI_BUN_ROOT` under a trusted OS temporary
directory; confirmed session records and snapshots are then archived beside its
profile and logs.
Worker cleanup uses the native driver's authenticated session controls and
checks daemon retirement, including interrupted starts. It runs after success,
timeout, and cancellation before temporary files can be removed or a worker
reused. Unconfirmed cleanup halts dispatch and retains the evidence. tmux
cleanup remains scoped to the worker's own transport.

The coordinator snapshots the current authored files, including uncommitted
changes, and copies the generated distributions once before creating independent
worker checkouts. Default local Git clones hardlink object files where possible,
copy them across filesystems, and preserve existing alternate stores without
extending their reference chain. Linked worktrees with alternate stores use Git
transport for the initial snapshot so relative object references resolve
correctly; their selected revision is preserved. Installed dependencies are
shared; working files and Git indexes are independent. Tests still execute the same files,
fixtures, live opt-ins and assertions. Steps within a test keep their existing
order. Do not edit source or regenerate distributions while a snapshot is being
prepared.

Relative symlinks retain their original targets, including dangling links, so
writing through a fixture alias stays inside that worker. Snapshot preparation
rejects absolute links and links that escape the source root; the shared
dependency directory is an explicit exception. Tracked descendants are checked
component by component before sizing or copying; a symlink or junction in an
ancestor position is refused rather than followed, even when its leaf appears
to be a regular file. Relative IDE seed paths and
path-valued executable overrides resolve against the source checkout before the
worker starts. The IDE still copies the seed into its private profile.

Inspect the complete selection without building or starting a CLI. Combine
`--e2e-plan` with `--e2e`: it implies `--isolated-e2e` but does not select the e2e
tier itself.

```bash
bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 --e2e --e2e-plan
```

Example for an explicitly enabled Claude TUI selection:

```bash
AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1 bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 \
  --e2e --isolated-e2e --filter 't-tui-(?!kiro)' \
  --bedrock-parallel 2 \
  --e2e-timings tests/logs/<previous-stamp>/summary.txt
```

`--e2e-timings` is optional. Historical durations determine scheduling order,
never selection: new files still run. Without history, source timeout values
provide rough ordering hints. The longest eligible file starts first; work
without the saturated resource can use free workers. Bedrock, Kiro and IDE limits
are independent, and an IDE file consumes both a Kiro slot and an IDE slot.

These limits count **test files**, not HTTP requests. A workflow can spawn
multiple model-using agents internally. Claude SDK/TUI, Codex and default
opencode runs share the Bedrock budget even when configured regions differ.
Kiro ACP/TUI/IDE share the Kiro budget. Account authentication remains supplied by
the host. Generated IDE seeds prepare onboarding and still require a signed-in host.
Budgets apply to one coordinator: divide the account budget between simultaneous
jobs or machines instead of giving each job the entire allowance.
These provider limits apply to isolated E2E dispatch. Integration still uses its
ordinary per-tier scheduler; bound live SDK integration with filtered file lanes
when running it alongside another host, and keep deterministic integration in a
separate checkout. Unit shards also need separate checkouts because packaging
tests regenerate shared outputs within their checkout.

Native Windows Codex files also share a `windows-codex` serial group. Fresh
profiles select the [documented elevated Windows sandbox](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-basic#windows-sandbox-mode), whose setup uses host
accounts; concurrent initialization across profiles has not yet been verified.
One Codex file runs at a time while unrelated harnesses can use free workers and
provider slots. Run only one Codex coordinator on a Windows host. Use a logged-in
interactive session for these native runs; the validated runtime's sandbox
commands could not start from the SSH service session. Linux and macOS Codex
files continue to use the Bedrock limit.

On Windows, use the same native runner with `--e2e --isolated-e2e --filter
't-ide-kiro'`, set `AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_LIVE=1`, and choose `--ide-parallel`.
Each IDE launch copies its seed to a private profile and lets Electron allocate
the debugging port. The parent waits for that child's endpoint instead of
selecting a port using its PID. Begin at one IDE file, then compare two using
observed memory and completion times. The native command is
`bun tests/run-tests.ts --debug -P 8 --e2e --isolated-e2e ...`; this path does not
depend on the older Windows wrapper's fixed installation directories.
Windows profiles use the short per-file temporary directory to keep Electron's
nested database and log paths within its path limits. Test artifacts retain
their original paths. Teardown requests closure through the owned browser's CDP
endpoint and waits for the child to close; a cleanup failure preserves the
profile and remains visible alongside any earlier test failure.
The IDE adapter also retains an event-provided session ID on prompt submission,
so session identity remains available when a workspace startup callback was
not observed. Prompts without a session ID preserve the existing fallback state.

Keep the Windows desktop session logged in for GUI runs. Check the account panel
in a disposable profile before treating an installed IDE as authenticated.
The IDE and CLI have separate login checks; a signed-in IDE does not satisfy
the Kiro CLI or Cursor CLI gates. Keep profile seeds on the Windows host and
collect test results and traces separately from their user-data directories.

The runner writes these additional artifacts under its timestamped log directory:

- `e2e-plan.json`: exact selected inventory, estimates and resource requirements.
- `e2e-events.ndjson`: dispatch/completion events, worker IDs and queue times.
- `e2e-results.json`: selected/prerequisite files, source revision/dirty state,
  worker assignment, case pass/fail/skip counts, durations, timeout/cleanup
  outcomes and diagnostic throttle-pattern counts.
- `e2e-artifacts/<test>/`: retained JUnit and isolated SDK/TUI/IDE traces.
- `e2e-artifacts/<test>/deferred-cleanup.json` (under `attempt-N/` in
  isolated-file runs): Windows Codex fixture retention
  after the coordinator verifies native process retirement. These fixtures move
  to `retained-fixtures/` even on success; the host owns final deletion of the
  protected sandbox files. A cross-volume copy keeps the original too.
- `failed-fixtures/<label>-<pid>-<n>/`: a bounded snapshot of a failed live SDK
  fixture (t183, t193), taken by `tests/harness/failed-fixture.ts` because the
  fixture itself lives under the OS temporary directory that a hosted runner
  discards. The workflow record under `aidlc/` is copied first; links are never
  followed, `node_modules/` and `.git/` are skipped, and per-file, file-count,
  total-size and walk caps apply. `retained-fixture.json` counts every entry
  left out by reason and lists the first of them by path.
  The live collectors copy it with the rest of the log tree and the sanitizer
  redacts it before upload.
- `e2e-worker-storage.json`: checkout pool location, estimated snapshot size,
  and whether checkout copies were retained. Windows pools use short private
  paths under the system temporary directory so deep report paths do not break
  fixture copies.

The Kiro reviewer journey saves its primary artifact and matched review receipt
before assertions. The scope-exclusion journey saves its final state and audit,
including on timeout. That journey uses a fully specified miniature security
patch while retaining whole-workflow completion and the scope-derived forbidden
stage checks; setup and both SDK drives share the original case deadline.

Per-file output is saved incrementally. An outer deadline or interrupted run
remains a failure/incomplete result; it is never converted to a passing retry.
Verbose/debug runs retain per-file JUnit and an `.execution.json` record of
effective coverage gates for every tier. These records contain coverage
controls, not the full process environment or credentials.
Every test file runs under an owned process supervisor, including ordinary
smoke/unit/integration execution. A debug-log write failure stops further
dispatch, retires admitted test processes, and leaves a nonzero runner result.
Ordinary files also receive private temporary directories and terminal
namespaces, which lets the runner retire native sessions after a test aborts.
If the result volume itself is unwritable, missing captures remain incomplete.
They cannot establish successful coverage.

Codex live tests use `tests/harness/codex-test-lifecycle.ts` to retain the original
failure and full exec output while reserving cleanup time. On Windows, verified
runner-owned fixtures are removed only after the coordinator retires their
process tree; failures preserve those fixtures with the diagnostic artifacts.
The exec driver disables the interactive `request_user_input` feature, which
Codex exec cannot service, and exercises the skill's prose approval fallback.
Approval assertions and sandbox permissions remain required.

Windows provisioning fixtures require their temporary accounts and processes
to be retired before returning. A profile hive still held by Windows services
is recorded for VM disposal only on GitHub-hosted runners; persistent hosts
must delete it within the bounded cleanup operation.
Windows deterministic E2E jobs download the checksum-pinned Codex command runner
and set `AIDLC_CODEX_RUNNER_PROBE` so the native bootstrap regression runs alongside
the existing filesystem and account tests. It makes no model calls. For a local
diagnostic, point that variable at the verified runner executable; optionally set
`AIDLC_CODEX_RUNNER_PROBE_ONLY=1` to select the bootstrap and launcher checks.
That diagnostic selection skips the other provisioning cases and is not a full
coverage result.

Worker preparation checks free space for the snapshot and checkout copies,
plus a reserve of 512 MiB. Each isolated file checks the reserve before starting.
`AIDLC_E2E_MIN_FREE_BYTES` overrides the reserve in bytes (a nonnegative integer).
This admission check cannot predict all runtime fixture growth. Ordinary
assertion failures retain their fixtures and diagnostic records, then release
the disposable checkout pool. `AIDLC_KEEP_TEMP=1` or unconfirmed process cleanup
retains checkout copies for investigation.
Scheduling does not extend live workflow deadlines. The terminal substrate preflight
runs before selected TUI work, including filtered selections. Normal assertion
failures do not prevent unrelated files from running.

The revision-loop TUI test runs its clean and reject/revise/approve journeys
concurrently in separate projects, Claude profiles, and terminal sessions.
Both must reach the same completion milestone within one 60-minute file budget,
with time reserved for cleanup. Each journey retains its own terminal state,
native fidelity evidence, and cleanup result.

The test also stops waiting after a confirmed, completed root
HTTP 5xx failure in its fresh Claude transcript. It records the provider error
and native transcript, stops its owned answer-gate client, and performs normal
terminal cleanup. This does not retry the model, erase the failure, or change the
healthy workflow deadline. Tool output, subagent errors, recovered history, and
errors after the test's completion milestone do not trigger this early failure.

Use `--e2e-cancel-file <path>` when a controller needs portable cancellation,
especially on Windows where terminating a process does not deliver POSIX
signals. Creating that file stops dispatch and terminates active owned workers.
POSIX SIGINT/SIGTERM uses the same cleanup path. Forced host/process termination
cannot execute cleanup; the incremental results still show unfinished files.

The legacy summary and failed-file exit convention remain available. Failure
exit codes cap at 255 so a run with 256 unfinished files cannot wrap to a
successful process status; the summary retains the complete failure count.
For a required nightly gate, add `--require-coverage`: skipped cases, empty
files, unexecuted selected files, and an empty selection produce a nonzero exit.
Every verbose run writes `coverage.json` with the selected inventory and case
counts, and prints `Coverage: COMPLETE` or `INCOMPLETE` separately from test
failures. Use platform-specific selections for required gates; intentional
platform skips in a broad discovery run do not satisfy them.
The effective inventory includes automatically required preflights, even under
a narrow filename filter. `requestedFiles` counts the original selection;
`selectedFiles` includes those prerequisites once. A terminal prerequisite must
produce valid, nonempty, passing evidence with no skipped cases before a TUI
journey can start.
JUnit evidence must be a complete document whose suite totals match its
testcase records. A positive header in a truncated report cannot satisfy the
gate. Final cleanup/publication errors set the run to `ERROR`, independently of
the testcase outcomes.
`e2e-results.json` additionally distinguishes an all-skipped file from executed
coverage, and `coverageComplete` is false for skipped, empty or incomplete
files. A no-LLM or platform-specific run may legitimately have incomplete live
coverage; aggregate the expected platform/provider jobs before claiming full
nightly coverage. Throttle-pattern counts are diagnostic matches in output,
which can include quoted text; they do not establish a provider quota failure.

## Required jobs across platforms

`tests/native-terminal-profile.json` assigns deterministic terminal controls to
Linux/Bun, macOS/Bun, Windows/Bun and Linux/tmux jobs. Portable
controls run on all three operating systems; native Linux and macOS containment,
Windows Job Object and sharing-handle checks, and compatibility backends have
explicit owners. The profile targets Linux arm64, macOS arm64 (`macos-15`) and
Windows x64; declare separate matching obligations for another architecture.
Platform-specific controls live in separately selectable test files. Their
assertions remain required by the profile.

Prepare one plan before dispatch, using the authored source that every host will
receive:

```bash
bun tests/reconcile-tests.ts prepare \
  --profile tests/native-terminal-profile.json --cohort "nightly-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" \
  --repo . --output tmp/native-plan.json
```

The plan contains the exact job/file/testcase inventories, cohort ID and a digest
of authored source, including uncommitted bytes. Copy the same source bytes and
plan to the other host. Keep plans and results in ignored or external storage.
Root paths, timestamps and Git commit IDs alone are not source identity.

Run each job with matching tier/filter flags and the declared backend. For
example, derive a precise filter for the native profile's Linux job:

```bash
TEST_MATRIX_PLAN=tmp/native-plan.json
TEST_MATRIX_JOB=linux-bun
TEST_MATRIX_FILTER=$(bun -e '
  const plan = await Bun.file(process.argv[1]).json();
  const job = plan.jobs.find(job => job.id === process.argv[2]);
  if (!job) throw new Error("unknown matrix job");
  const names = job.files.map(({path}) => {
    const parts = path.split("/");
    if (parts[0] !== "tests") throw new Error("expected native-profile test path");
    return `${parts[1]}-${parts.at(-1).replace(/\.test\.ts$/, "")}`
      .replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&");
  });
  console.log(`^(?:${names.join("|")})$`);
' "$TEST_MATRIX_PLAN" "$TEST_MATRIX_JOB")
AIDLC_TUI_BACKEND=bun bash tests/run-tests.sh --debug -P 8 \
  --unit --integration --e2e --no-llm --isolated-e2e \
  --filter "$TEST_MATRIX_FILTER" \
  --matrix-plan "$TEST_MATRIX_PLAN" --matrix-job "$TEST_MATRIX_JOB" \
  > tmp/native-linux-run.log 2>&1
```

`--matrix-plan` and `--matrix-job` imply strict coverage. The runner verifies
the actual source, platform, architecture, selected backend and effective file
inventory before dispatch. It seals `test-matrix-receipt.json` after cleanup and
report publication, recording the actual Bun version, whitelisted live gates,
JUnit hashes and validated testcase outcomes. Source changes, missing cases,
skips and finalization failures prevent a successful receipt.
Isolated jobs also hash the worker's authored source before and after each file,
before that checkout can be reused or removed; the observations remain in
`matrix-worker-source.json`. Reconciliation refuses an output path that would
overwrite its plan, receipts or referenced JUnit evidence.
On Windows, Bun 1.3.14 can prematurely time out a synchronous child after an
asynchronous pause. Source verification retries only an early `ETIMEDOUT` from
its read-only Git queries, at most once and with the remaining original budget.
It logs that recovery; real deadline exhaustion, other errors and test failures
are not retried by this mechanism. `t-test-source-timeout.test.ts` checks both
the budget contract and the real asynchronous-gap regression.

Collect each receipt together with its stamp directory, preserving relative
JUnit paths, then reconcile all required jobs:

```bash
bun tests/reconcile-tests.ts reconcile --plan tmp/native-plan.json \
  --receipt "<linux-bun-stamp>/test-matrix-receipt.json" \
  --receipt "<darwin-bun-stamp>/test-matrix-receipt.json" \
  --receipt "<windows-bun-stamp>/test-matrix-receipt.json" \
  --receipt "<linux-tmux-stamp>/test-matrix-receipt.json" \
  --output tmp/native-matrix-result.json
```

Only a complete matching matrix exits zero. Missing jobs, wrong source/cohort or
backend, changed JUnit, real failures and conflicting receipts remain failures;
a later passing receipt cannot erase an earlier failure. Explicitly excluded
profile obligations appear as `NOT_REQUESTED`, never as fulfilled coverage.

This profile verifies the terminal driver and retained compatibility controls.
The scheduled preview calls `full-suite.yml`, which reconciles native
receipts and requires every declared job to pass. Skipped live jobs fail the
suite; documented excluded families remain untested.

### Nightly full-suite matrix and provisioning

`Full Suite` is callable with an explicit `ref` and manually dispatchable
(default `main`, both verification flags false). Its ordinary plan accepts the
requested branch or commit, including an unmerged PR, and resolves it once.
All matrix legs check out that immutable SHA. The preview and stable release
workflows enforce their own publication source policy; Full Suite does not
require a commit to be on `main` just to test it.
Scheduled and manual `preview-release.yml` runs call it after
packaging determinism, typecheck, lint, and installer shell checks, even when the
source already has a published preview. Preview does not call the PR CI test
matrix again; Full Suite owns its test coverage. A failing Full Suite does not
stop the preview build. The `Release tests` job renders a report of the failed
legs, failed jobs and failing test cases with `scripts/ci-preview-test-report.ts`.
It writes the report to the run summary and a `preview-test-report` artifact.
The published preview notes then open with a warning and end with that report.
The planned notes stay whole. The report, and when even that leaves no room the
warning, gives way first, so a failing suite never stops a preview whose planned
notes fit GitHub's 125,000-character release limit.
The `update-from-previous` job (`scripts/ci-update-from-previous.ts`) updates an
install of the last stable release to the candidate on Linux, macOS and Windows
and runs every harness project's hooks, refresh and doctor. When it fails, the
preview still publishes, its notes open with a warning and the report gains a
line for it; `release.yml` does not publish a stable release that fails it.
`Release result` requires successful preview publication or an intentional
skip. Full Suite runs separately: the preview records its run ID, downloads
that run's evidence and reports its real result, without propagating its failure.
An unchanged source skips publication but still receives the test report. Stable releases consume `full-suite-result`: the tag
workflow validates that the exact tagged commit is on `main` and matches the
authored version, reuses or produces a passing release-purpose Full Suite result
for that commit, and runs contract checks and validates built native binaries,
installers, lifecycle flows, checksums, and provenance. Deterministic source tiers and production guards remain in PR/merge CI and manual
`full_verification`; the ordinary release Full Suite omits them. Preview also runs contract
checks and Full Suite once, with publication deduplication applied only to the
subsequent build and publication chain.

For user-approved full validation of an unmerged PR, select its branch and set
`ref` to that branch's exact workflow-head SHA:

```bash
gh workflow run full-suite.yml --ref '<candidate-branch>' \
  -f 'ref=<exact-workflow-head-sha>' -f full_verification=true
```

Full verification runs every job that receives no credentials: native
obligations and reconciliation, all deterministic tiers, production guards and
Windows release contracts. Because it may select unmerged code, it never runs
the three `live_prepare_*` jobs, `live_linux`, `live_macos` or `live_windows` (the jobs that
request OIDC and AWS credentials); cover a candidate's live families with `live_verification`,
the separately authorized mode below. Every checkout in Full Suite sets
`persist-credentials: false`, so candidate code never finds the repository token
on disk. It otherwise uses the same file matrices, assertions and timeouts as an
ordinary Full Suite run. The separate `full-suite-verification-result` artifact
contains `full-suite-result.json` with `purpose: "full-verification"`; `passed`
requires every other job to succeed, the six live/preparation jobs to be `skipped`,
`verificationFamily: "all"` and `omittedLegs` naming exactly those six jobs.
Neither preview nor stable publication consumes this result, even after the
candidate merges.

`full_verification` exists only on `workflow_dispatch`. It requires the checked-out
SHA to equal the selected workflow head, is mutually exclusive with
`live_verification`, and rejects family/file filters. No push or pull-request
event automatically starts privileged full verification.

For user-approved live-only candidate validation, manually dispatch Full Suite on the
candidate branch with `live_verification=true` and set `ref` to that branch's
exact workflow-head SHA:

```bash
gh workflow run full-suite.yml --ref '<candidate-branch>' \
  -f 'ref=<exact-workflow-head-sha>' -f live_verification=true
```

To repeat only one family while other coverage is already running, add
`-f verification_family=codex`. The manual choices are `all` (default),
`claude-sdk`, `claude-tui`, `codex`, and `opencode`. A family other than `all`
requires live-verification mode and the same manual event/exact-head checks.
It selects only that family's rows on Linux/macOS/Windows, retaining the
original per-platform N/M shard numbers. The separate Windows release-contract
job is omitted for scoped verification. No family selector is exposed to
reusable callers, and ordinary release-purpose runs must use `all`.

For one test file, also pass its exact repository path:

```bash
gh workflow run full-suite.yml --ref '<candidate-branch>' \
  -f 'ref=<exact-workflow-head-sha>' -f live_verification=true \
  -f verification_family=claude-sdk \
  -f verification_test=tests/integration/t238-user-stories-mob.sdk.test.ts
```

The file must belong to the selected family. Unknown paths and mismatched
families fail planning. It runs on its declared platforms: portable tests use
all three OSes, while a Windows-only case uses Windows. Preparation covers only
those runners. Original shard identities remain intact, and the result records
`verificationTest`, `verificationPlatforms` and any omitted job explicitly.
This selection is not consumed by stable publication.

These verification inputs exist only on `workflow_dispatch`, never `workflow_call`.
Authorization requires that event and that the checked-out SHA equals
`github.sha`; selecting the workflow on `main` cannot authorize a different
branch's source. No push or pull-request trigger starts privileged verification.
The mode runs `plan`, the three `live_prepare_*` jobs, `live_linux`, `live_macos`, `live_windows`,
and `release_contract_windows`. It intentionally skips native terminal/reconciliation,
deterministic tiers, and production guards, so it does not repeat deterministic
CI. Existing provider opt-ins, strict live coverage and credential isolation
remain in effect.

The separate `full-suite-live-verification-result` artifact contains
`full-suite-result.json` with `purpose: "live-verification"`, `verificationFamily`,
the omitted jobs in
`omittedLegs`, and `complete: false`. Its `passed` requires every live job to
succeed and every intentionally omitted job to be `skipped`; missing, failed,
cancelled or unexpectedly executed jobs fail. Even a successful verification
of `main` is not consumed by stable publication. Ordinary Full Suite runs keep
the `full-suite-result` artifact name and require all jobs except the explicitly omitted deterministic
and production-guard jobs; older artifacts
without the release purpose do not satisfy the Full Suite result policy.

The three independent `live_prepare_*` jobs call `live-prepare.yml` to install
dependencies and package projections with contents-read permission only. Each
live OS job waits only for its own platform preparation. POSIX preparation selects official Node
22.23.2 and packs its complete install prefix with the pinned CLIs
(`ci-live-deps.py pack --cli ... --node-runtime ...`). The validated archive
requires both `bin/node` and its library directory. The isolated runtime copies
that prefix into its root-owned tools tree and puts `node/bin` on PATH,
preserving loader-relative libraries. Node and CLI startup are checked after
runner directories are protected. Copying a lone Homebrew executable loses
dependencies such as `@rpath/libnode` and is not supported.
Windows CLI installation stays inside its isolated user.
This closes [#1306](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/1306): installers
never run with OIDC in scope, and credentialed lanes only validate and unpack
prepared bytes. Every authorized Full Suite run executes preparation and hosted
live jobs using the existing `ai-pr-review` environment. There is no separate
live opt-in switch in this release workflow. Missing
prerequisites, skipped jobs, or failed tests fail an ordinary Full Suite run.
They do not block preview publication: the preview still builds, its notes end
with a Full Suite failure report, and only the separate Full Suite run stays red. They block stable
publication: `release.yml` refuses to publish without a passing result for the
tagged commit. The credential-free
Windows release-contract job also runs.

The declared coverage is:

- In manual `full_verification` only: deterministic smoke, twelve independent
  unit shards, integration and isolated E2E on Linux, macOS and Windows. Integration and E2E have separate jobs,
  each with eight workers and its own runner process and evidence. Every unit file is
  assigned to one shard per OS; each shard retains its own debug logs and results.
- In manual `full_verification` only: a Linux production-guard slice selects `--production-guards` and
  `--require-coverage` for the runner and recovery contracts. Those cases are
  therefore exercised even though ordinary fixture-mode tiers skip them.
- Source-bound native terminal obligations on Linux arm64/Bun and tmux,
  macOS arm64/Bun (`macos-15`), and Windows/Bun. Hosted Windows supplies Node
  for other tooling; Bun installs the pinned dependencies.
- Claude SDK, Claude TUI, Codex, opencode and release-endpoint contracts on
  hosted Linux/macOS/Windows, including Claude plugin invocation in the strict SDK leg.
- Kiro ACP, TUI and IDE are declared exclusions pending a dedicated isolated
  Windows desktop host; local live runs remain their coverage path.
- Cursor is excluded: no credential separation is available because its vendor
  CLI reads the API key from the agent environment. Copilot remains excluded by
  account policy; neither exclusion is reported as successful coverage.

`scripts/ci-live-filter.ts --list` prints the discovered family partition.
After authorization and dependency installation, the plan emits `--matrix
linux`, `--matrix macos` and `--matrix windows` as the dynamic matrices of the
`live_linux`, `live_macos` and `live_windows` jobs. Each row's `shard: N/M`
selects a duration-balanced group for its family/platform. Each OS has two Claude
SDK (four on Linux, which alone runs the golden journeys), three Claude TUI, one
Codex and one opencode shard: 23 live harness jobs in all. Timing weights in
`tests/live-shard-weights.json` are scheduling hints;
discovery still assigns every eligible file exactly once per platform. Each OS
has its own concurrency cap: four Linux, two macOS and three Windows live jobs.
Every shard has at most two file workers; Windows Codex files remain serial.
Windows release-contract coverage stays in its separate unsharded job.

`--isolated-files` restores each worker from the original checkout snapshot
before its next file, including generated and Git state. Each file/attempt gets
fresh HOME/USERPROFILE, temporary directories, Claude/Codex/opencode and XDG
profiles, a private Git config and a private copy of the broker-only AWS config.
Installed tools and dependencies are reused. The existing process/transport
retirement checks must succeed before a slot is reused. Cleanup uncertainty
stops dispatch and marks remaining files incomplete.

`--file-retries 1` retries only a short failed file after confirmed cleanup, in
fresh state, while retaining both attempts under `e2e-artifacts/<file>/attempt-N`.
(Without `--isolated-files`, the same flag retries smoke, unit and integration
files in a fresh process; the merge queue uses that, as described above.)
Timeouts, incomplete evidence and cleanup failures are not retried. Passing
files are not rerun. Each shard retains its authenticated isolation and required
capability preflights. Manual `--family FAMILY --test <repository-path>` selects
only that file on its declared platforms while preserving its shard identity.
Dependency preparation uses fast gzip compression and uploads the resulting
archive without a second compression pass to shorten startup.

Every Full Suite job name leads with its runner OS, then its lane and matrix
item, for example `Linux / claude-tui 3/3`, `macOS / deterministic unit-3`,
`Windows / native-terminal bun` or `Windows / release-contract`, so the
Actions UI groups a run's jobs by OS. Result `legs` keep the job ids, and the
preview report groups failed jobs by OS and lane.

Each credentialed job requests a 3,600-second session from the existing role.
Jobs have an 80-minute limit and live test steps have a 70-minute limit. Every
live family receives a 3,600-second shared runner budget and independent file
deadline, including ordinary integration/SDK files. Driver work reserves up to
five minutes within that envelope for cleanup; collection continues after
failures and timeouts. An older journey's longer local timeout does not extend
the hosted budget. Exhaustion is a visible failure with incomplete coverage.

`bun scripts/ci-live-filter.ts claude-tui --platform linux` prints an anchored
runner filter. Discovery uses each file's own integration/e2e live gate variables,
the derived Claude substrate list, and the unit release-contract opt-in; using a
generic plugin helper does not claim coverage for every provider it supports.
Unit gate-fixture tests are deterministic, not live families. `PLATFORM_ONLY`
declares separately selectable Windows-only files; it never hides a skipped case
inside a selected file. All live provider legs use `--require-coverage`;
release-contract files retain platform-conditional cases and do not use that flag.

Outside the native profile, deterministic and release-contract results are job
outcomes, not proof that every individual case ran somewhere in the OS matrix.
Their debug artifacts retain per-file case counts, skipped cases and JUnit.
There is no source-bound inventory assigning all such cases to applicable OSes
and reconciling those receipts across jobs. Applying `--require-coverage` to each
whole tier would also reject legitimate platform-inapplicable cases; a green job
does not convert those skips into passes. Full case coverage across OSes remains
an explicit gap until that inventory and reconciliation exist.

Add `--args` to print the complete runner arguments, one per line. The script
owns tier selection: it emits only tiers with selected files and applies each
family's strict-coverage policy. Live integration and E2E files use
`--isolated-files`; unit release contracts retain their existing execution path.
Production-guard journeys receive the production profile independently, including
when they share a shard with fixture-profile files. The workflow uses `--run`
to spawn the runner directly from the repository root, preserving each argument
without shell word splitting or Bash-version-specific builtins:

```bash
bun scripts/ci-live-filter.ts claude-sdk --platform linux --run -- --debug -P 8
```

For a selection containing e2e files, append `--e2e-plan` to inspect its plan
without executing tests. Do not append it to an integration-only or unit-only
selection: that mode intentionally rejects an empty e2e selection. Deterministic
`--no-llm` runs omit the closed Claude health preflight and record its file as
skipped, without treating the deliberate skip as a prerequisite failure.

Artifacts are `full-suite-native-plan`, `full-suite-native-<job>` (complete log
stamp directories and JUnit), `full-suite-native-result`,
`full-suite-production-guards`,
`full-suite-deterministic-<suite>-<OS>` (suite is `smoke`, `unit-1` through
`unit-12`, `integration`, `scope-runs`, `guard-matrix`, or `e2e`),
`full-suite-scope-runs-<OS>` and `full-suite-guard-matrix-<OS>` (the release
`scope_runs` job), `full-suite-live-<family>-<slice-number>-<OS>`,
`full-suite-live-release-contract-Windows`, and the purpose-specific result
(90-day retention): `full-suite-result` for `purpose: "release"`,
`full-suite-live-verification-result` for `"live-verification"`, and
`full-suite-verification-result` for `"full-verification"`. The final JSON records `sha`, `runId`,
`runAttempt`, `purpose`, `verificationFamily`, `coveragePolicy`, `passed`, `complete`, every job's result in `legs`,
`disabledLegs: []`, `omittedLegs`, and live families declared with `hosting: "excluded"` in the
sorted `excluded` list. For `purpose: "release"` under `required-hosted-live-shards-v3`, `passed` requires a 40-hex commit ID, exactly `deterministic` and
`production_guards` omitted and skipped, and every other declared job, `scope_runs` included, successful.
Missing, failed, cancelled or unexpectedly skipped required jobs fail. `disabledLegs` is retained so the Full Suite result policy can reject
historical disabled-live reports. `complete` additionally requires
no excluded families; it remains false with the documented Kiro/Cursor/Copilot
exclusions and is not the preview-publication predicate. Those exclusions warn
without failing the suite; disabled required jobs fail it.
The stable gate, `scripts/ci-full-suite-evidence.ts check`, accepts a result only
when `sha` is the tagged commit, `runId` is the run it came from, `purpose` is
`"release"`, `verificationFamily` is `"all"`, `coveragePolicy` is
`required-hosted-live-shards-v3`, `passed` is true, `disabledLegs` is empty, and
`omittedLegs` is exactly the two deterministic/production-guard job IDs. Those jobs
must be skipped; all other declared jobs and extra legs must have succeeded.
It does not require `complete`, so the documented exclusions only warn.
Neither job success nor this policy marker asserts full case coverage across OSes.

Native jobs use the Bash wrapper with `--debug -P 8` and their unchanged
matrix plan/job selectors. Their artifacts include `tests/logs/` plus the
sanitized root `tmp/full-suite-native/` capture and literal stamp path; native
receipt reconciliation still discovers the receipts recursively.

Shared deterministic artifacts contain `tests/logs/<stamp>/` and
`tmp/ci-deterministic/` (full stdout/stderr plus the literal stamp path). CI
artifacts use `ci-deterministic-<suite>-<OS>`, where suite is smoke,
unit-1 through unit-12, integration, or e2e (expanded manual matrix only).
An upload requires both log locations
to pass sanitization, including after a failed test command.

Kiro ACP/TUI/IDE live families are declared exclusions in the nightly full suite,
printed as warnings and leaving `complete: false`. They need a dedicated isolated
Windows desktop host running Kiro under a separate low-privilege identity.
Local runs with `AIDLC_KIRO_ACP_LIVE=1`, `AIDLC_KIRO_TUI_LIVE=1` or
`AIDLC_KIRO_IDE_LIVE=1` remain the coverage path. A follow-up issue tracks the
hosted lane.

The live jobs use the existing `ai-pr-review` environment and role. Verify these
prerequisites before running Full Suite:

- Environment `ai-pr-review` supplies secret `AWS_AI_PR_REVIEW_ROLE_ARN`.
  `live_linux`, `live_macos` and `live_windows` select that environment; the secret is
  resolved inside those jobs. A workflow that calls `full-suite.yml` must pass
  `secrets: inherit`: without it the secret resolved empty in called runs, and
  every live job failed at "Assume nightly Bedrock role". Each live job now
  checks the secret first and fails at once with a message naming
  `secrets: inherit`.
  No Kiro/Cursor API-key workflow secret or hosted vendor-key leg is supported.
  The AWS role's OIDC trust must be scoped to
  this repository's `environment:ai-pr-review` subject. Each assumption requests
  3,600 seconds, within the existing one-hour role duration. The workflow splits
  work into bounded file jobs without changing IAM session duration.
- The role needs Bedrock invoke/stream access to the CI-only model table in
  `scripts/ci-credential-broker.ts`: Claude Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 4.6 and
  Haiku 4.5 inference profiles in `us-east-1`, opencode's Sonnet 4.6 default in
  that region, and Codex `openai.gpt-5.5` through Bedrock Mantle in `us-east-2`.
  The table pins the broker allowlist and Claude client aliases; shipped user
  settings remain provider-neutral.

Missing environment access, role trust, model permissions, or required live
substrates fails readiness; the workflow does not create a new environment or role.

Claude Code and opencode npm versions are pinned in the workflow; update those
pins deliberately after verifying the registry and compatibility. CLI/authentication preflights fail
loudly rather than letting absent substrates masquerade as passing live tests.

#### Credential isolation and uploaded evidence

Live models receive repository content and can invoke tools, so treat their
shells and tool-result traces as untrusted sinks for credentials. The AWS action
returns masked step outputs without exporting AWS credentials to subsequent
steps. A trusted startup helper receives those values only in its own step env,
sends JSON over stdin to a detached, environment-scrubbed broker process, and
exits before live agents run. The broker stores credentials only in memory and
performs signed STS `GetCallerIdentity` at startup; only its nonsecret account,
ARN and loopback port leave the broker. There is no credential-returning route,
credential process, credentials file or credential-bearing agent environment.

The loopback proxy admits only the configured model IDs and
`POST /model/<id>/(invoke|invoke-with-response-stream|converse|converse-stream)`
(optionally under `/bedrock`), plus Codex Mantle
`POST /openai/v1/responses` with `model: openai.gpt-5.5`. It removes client
authentication headers and signs each upstream request; successful streams are
forwarded byte-for-byte. Other routes are forbidden, redirects are not followed,
and upstream error bodies are suppressed because AWS errors can echo signatures.

Claude uses documented `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1`; its t19 preflight checks the broker's startup
identity, followed by a real SDK turn. Codex 0.151.0 uses a provider `base_url`
ending `/openai/v1`, verified against a loopback endpoint; the service-specific
Bedrock Runtime override alone does **not** redirect Codex's Mantle traffic.
Every scratch Codex home uses the shared Bedrock configuration renderer, including
compose, workspace and memory journeys. Outside the isolated CI runtime, leaving
`AIDLC_CODEX_AWS_PROFILE` unset or empty omits the profile from `config.toml`,
allowing the AWS SDK default credential chain to resolve credentials, including an
EC2 instance role. To keep using an existing named profile, set
`AIDLC_CODEX_AWS_PROFILE=codex` (or its actual name); a profile named `codex` is no
longer selected implicitly. `AIDLC_CODEX_AWS_REGION` still defaults to `us-east-2`.
The isolated CI runtime explicitly sets `AIDLC_CODEX_AWS_PROFILE=codex` to select
its dummy `broker` keys on Linux, macOS and Windows. Opencode profiles also contain
only dummy keys. Opencode selects `AWS_PROFILE=broker` so its prerequisite
check recognizes that profile; its documented provider `endpoint` override
routes AI SDK requests through the proxy.
Codex shell policy excludes provider/broker/API/GitHub/Actions variables, and the
runner strips CI control-plane credentials before launching any live test.

Hosted Linux/macOS live agents run as the separate unprivileged `aidlc-live`
user in a private checkout copy, using an explicit `sudo ... env -i` environment
and root-owned readable/executable tools. They cannot read the launcher process's
procfs environment, runner home, original checkout or Actions command files.

Linux Codex preparation installs distro `bubblewrap` and exposes a root-owned
symlink to `/usr/bin/bwrap` on the live PATH, preserving its AppArmor attachment.
When Ubuntu restricts unprivileged user namespaces, preparation loads the existing
`/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict` profile, or installs the distro's extra
profile from `apparmor-profiles` with `apparmor-utils`. The global restriction
must remain unchanged. This follows the official
[Codex sandbox prerequisites](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sandboxing#prerequisites);
Codex retains `workspace-write`.
Before AWS setup, the scrubbed live user must create a bubblewrap user namespace,
execute Bun and write in its private temp directory. Even as root inside that
namespace, it must not read the runner home, original checkout, Actions environment
file, launcher environment, or temporary runner-owned/root-owned sentinel files.
The proof repeats after broker startup; failure blocks live execution.

Windows creates a standard Users-only account and ACL-isolated work/home/tools
under `C:\aidlc-live`; Task Scheduler launches each body with a Limited batch
logon under that identity, avoiding the runner session's desktop ACL. Preparation
grants only `SeBatchLogonRight` while preserving existing principals, then verifies
an actual batch-logon task. Preparation tasks, including Git and smoke probes,
default to 30 minutes. Credentialed test tasks retain a 64-minute ceiling
inside the workflow's 70-minute live test step.
Tasks not started within the five-minute native-startup backstop fail with
scheduler status and the last 20 operational events. Explicit safe environments
and UTF-8 identity/cwd/output logs remain, and tasks are unregistered after completion.
Secondary-logon `Start-Process` is a
reported fallback only if task registration itself fails. Batch sessions may
use session 0: the proof requires correct user identity and access denied for
launcher modules/`PROCESS_VM_READ`, runner directories and private credential state.
The broker stays under the runner identity; only nonsecret routes and model pins
cross into the live user's environment. Failed isolation proofs block execution.

Windows Codex also provisions its two native sandbox identities and verifies
both using fresh test homes. The readiness command runs through PowerShell and
Bun under the actual sandbox: the shell must start in the project, Bun must
canonicalize its path, and credential reads and writes outside the workspace
must remain denied. The sandbox identities receive directory metadata and
traversal access on the three private containers above the fixtures, with no
inherited permission to list their contents or read their files.
Readiness checks the native initializer's exit status independently of its
fixed phase diagnostics on stderr; a missing or nonzero status blocks execution.
The native launcher allows five minutes for fresh-home initialization to accommodate
hosted Windows cold-start variation, then refuses execution if that deadline expires.
Each native CLI process is assigned to its own Windows job before being resumed.
After the CLI exits, the launcher retires that job's descendants before draining
stdout and stderr, so inherited pipe handles cannot hold the invocation open.
POSIX collection stops the dedicated account's processes before administrator
copying. On macOS it first retires that account's launchd user/GUI domains to
stop service restarts. Zombie entries cannot execute; any other remaining
process, or an inventory failure, refuses collection. Failures include the
remaining PID/state rows. Only this job's newly created account is affected.

Every merge-queue run executes `test_live_isolation` on all three OSes, using the same preparation
and proof scripts plus `--smoke --filter '^t01'` under the sandbox identity,
without provider credentials. Credential-free Windows release-contract units
remain separately runnable. Hosted Windows live model coverage is real, not an
opt-in stub or a same-user exception.

Agents can still spend through the allowlisted proxy until the job timeout;
constrain IAM model permissions, quotas and runner access. This boundary trusts
the host kernel and administrators; OS privilege escalation is not in scope.
Cursor remains excluded because its CLI exposes the API key to agent tool shells.
Kiro uses only the dedicated CI-identity Windows host's existing sign-in, without
workflow-injected API keys. Runner-owned collection copies completed logs back
for sanitization before upload; it does not execute sandbox-authored code.

After Windows sandbox processes have stopped, test logs and launch logs are
collected independently. A failed test-tree copy still preserves validated
launch stdout/stderr under `tests/logs/windows-launch-<uuid>/`. Only complete,
validated trees are published; collection remains failed when either copy
fails. `tests/logs/windows-collection-<uuid>.json` records completion per source
and, on failure, the operation, safe relative path and exception codes. It omits
exception messages, absolute paths and sensitive path components. An uploaded
collection report or fallback log does not establish that a test passed.

Windows live legs also keep evidence for a hook that stops making progress.
`scripts/ci-live-sandbox.ts` sets `AIDLC_TEST_HOOK_TRACE=1` for every Windows
live family, and the runner binds `AIDLC_HOOK_TRACE_DIR` to each file attempt's
`e2e-artifacts/<file>/attempt-<n>/hook-trace/`, so every hook process in that
attempt writes its phases there (see
[Hook phase trace](06-hooks-and-tools.md#hook-phase-trace)). While a live run's
scheduled task runs, the runner-side wait loop in
`.github/scripts/prepare-live-runtime.ps1` checks the process table once a
minute. When a process owned by the isolated account with `engine hook ` or
`engine adapter ` in its command line has run 10 minutes, it writes one
`hook-stall-<time>.json` to
`tests/logs/windows-launch-<uuid>/hook-stalls-run-<id>/` with the stalled
process's tree (its isolated-account parents and all its children) and their
thread states, once per process. It reads process metadata only and checks
ownership only for the stalled process and its parents. Every query is capped
at what is left of a 60-second snapshot budget (15 seconds at most); a query
that is skipped, fails or times out marks the snapshot `truncated`. A stalled
process whose owner could not be checked is listed under `ownerUnknown` with
only its id, name and start time (no command line, no children), since it
may belong to another account. It never fails the run. The hook trace's `.ndjson` files follow the trace-retention rule below.
Linux and macOS legs turn neither on.

Every full-suite `tests/logs/` upload first runs `scripts/ci-sanitize-logs.ts` and
is blocked if sanitization fails. Full-suite and shared deterministic jobs retain
eligible driver NDJSON, `sdk-drive*`, `tui-drive*` and `e2e-artifacts/**/traces`
by default so tool calls, completion boundaries and timeout behavior remain
available for diagnosis. Repository variable `AIDLC_NIGHTLY_UPLOAD_TRACES=0`
opts out of trace retention. The standalone sanitizer still deletes these traces
unless its `AIDLC_NIGHTLY_UPLOAD_TRACES` environment variable is `1`. Invalid
UTF-8, UTF-16, NUL-containing and other non-text files are always deleted, with
their relative paths and reasons recorded in `sanitizer-report.json`; there is
no binary/screenshot allowlist. Remaining UTF-8 text is redacted for AWS
credentials, vendor keys, bearer tokens and Anthropic keys; links are removed
without following targets. Redaction remains defense in depth, not proof against
encoded secrets; retaining raw text traces increases that residual risk.

## Kiro prompt-hook transport controls

Kiro's agent-v1 prompt hook has a default `max_output_size` of 10 KiB,
independent of the shell tool's output budget. The adapter counts the complete
UTF-8 pre-dispatch packet, including its explanatory text, before injecting a
non-steering directive. Oversized packets and every `load-steering` directive
use the existing exact-argument forwarding latch so the engine's full JSON is
returned through the actual tool call. `--single` skips hook pre-dispatch
entirely, leaving its first issuance to that tool call.

`t147-kiro-hook-adapter.test.ts` checks the 10 KiB boundary with multibyte
content, native shell aliases, retained terminal guards, and a real multipart
engine round trip. It reconstructs every delivered rule byte and passes each
opaque continuation token unchanged. A token surviving alone does not prove
complete rule delivery; moving it before truncated rules is not a valid repair.

These deterministic controls test the adapter and engine stdout. They do not
calibrate a native Kiro release's tool-channel ceiling. Before changing that
transport budget, verify complete near-limit payloads on each supported native
platform. Increasing a hook's configured `max_output_size` also requires that
calibration; it does not change this adapter's conservative injection policy.

## Unit Sharding

`--unit --shard N/M` assigns every discovered unit file to exactly one of `M`
duration-balanced shards. Assignment is deterministic and uses
`tests/unit-shard-weights.json`, which records each file's duration on its
slowest CI OS. Unlisted files receive a one-second default weight, so new tests
join the least-loaded shard without changing the command. The runner exits 2 when `M` exceeds the number of
assignable groups, so no valid shard command can report success after running
zero files.

Each shard remains serial. Run separate shards in separate checkouts or CI jobs.
Do not run them concurrently against one repository tree because packaging
tests regenerate `dist/` and can race tests that read generated files.

The affinity list keeps cross-file prerequisites explicit. The native binary
builder test currently runs before the Copilot compiled-adapter coverage in the
same shard. After all native build/install assertions pass, t238 copies its
verified executable and adjacent `runtime/` into the runner-owned
`AIDLC_TEST_COMPILED_DIR`. Its private build/install fixtures are still removed
after the test; the published copy lives until runner cleanup (or is retained
with verbose logs). Each runner assigns a fresh handoff directory, so no shared
`build/binaries` output is overwritten or borrowed from a prior run.
Sharded unit execution requires t249 to resolve this handoff; a missing artifact
fails instead of silently skipping the compiled cases, even when an explicit
executable or an old repository build exists. Direct, non-sharded t249 runs can
still opt into `AIDLC_TEST_COMPILED_EXECUTABLE` or a local native build result.
The smoke runner contract verifies that all twelve CI shards are non-empty,
disjoint, cover the complete unit inventory, preserve producer/consumer ordering,
and fail compiled coverage when the producer is filtered out.

With more than one worker, the integration tier starts its parallel files
longest-first by `tests/integration-weights.json` (keyed by summary row name), so
a long file never starts last and sets the tier's wall time. Unweighted files
and ties keep name order; with no readable weights file, files start in name
order. Serial files and the smoke and unit tiers are unaffected.

Weights only balance and order files; they never select, skip, or fail one.
`scripts/ci-test-weights.ts refresh <dir>` rewrites both weight files from
deterministic CI evidence downloaded with
`gh run download <run-id> -p 'ci-deterministic-*' -D <dir>` (use several green
merge-group runs: each file takes its median per OS, then its slowest OS).
After each unit and integration job, the advisory "Report outdated test
weights" step runs `scripts/ci-test-weights.ts report`: a file that ran more
than a minute and more than 1.5 times past its weight gets a warning
annotation and a row in the job summary naming the refresh command. The step
always succeeds, so a stale weight slows CI but never fails a job or drops a
PR from the merge queue. `t-ci-test-weights.test.ts` covers the refresh, the
report, and the checked-in weight files.
