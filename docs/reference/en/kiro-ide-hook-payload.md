# Kiro IDE hook payload — empirical reference

How Kiro IDE delivers context to a command hook, captured live on 0.12-main
(probe `.kiro.hook` files that dumped stdin, argv, and the full environment),
1.0.165 (probe v2 hook JSON files; upstream #543/#555), and 1.0.242
(UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse probes on Windows). This is the evidence base
for the `harness/kiro-ide/` adapter; the CLI harness (`harness/kiro/`) uses a
different, kiro-cli-shaped stdin mechanism.

The redacted native Windows before/after captures are retained in
[`research/kiro-windows-output-encoding/`](research/kiro-windows-output-encoding/).

## The channel changed across IDE generations

| | Kiro IDE 0.12 | Kiro IDE 1.x (≥1.0.1xx) |
|---|---|---|
| Hook registration | `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` (`{"version":"1.0.0","when":{...},"then":{...}}`) | `.kiro/hooks/*.json` v2 schema (`{"version":"v1","hooks":[{name,trigger,matcher,action}]}`, PascalCase triggers). Legacy `.kiro.hook` files are **silently inert** — never executed. |
| Context channel | `USER_PROMPT` env var (JSON string) | **stdin** (JSON, written and closed). `USER_PROMPT` arrives empty. |
| stdin behavior | Opened but NEVER written/closed — a bare read hangs | Written and closed — a read resolves promptly |
| Field naming | camelCase: `{ toolName, toolArgs, toolResult, toolSuccess }` | snake_case: `{ session_id, hook_event_name, cwd, tool_name, tool_input, tool_response }` — **no success flag** |

A live 1.0.165 PostToolUse capture, field-verbatim:

```json
{"session_id":"sess_…","hook_event_name":"PostToolUse","cwd":"/path/to/project","tool_name":"execute_bash","tool_input":{},"tool_response":"Output:\n…\nExit Code: 0"}
```

The adapter uses a non-empty `USER_PROMPT` immediately (the 0.12 channel,
whose stdin never closes). When that variable is empty, it reads stdin for the
1.x channel, raced against a broken-channel timeout. The production default is
2s; a positive `AIDLC_IDE_STDIN_TIMEOUT_MS` value overrides the ceiling in
milliseconds for diagnostics and deterministic latency tests. Both field
spellings are accepted. Acquisition is gated to the payload-dependent targets,
including `plan-approval-guard`, `review-freeze`, `state-transition-guard`, the per-tool-call approval floor
(`enforce-approval-gate`, which on 1.x reads the invoking chat's `session_id` so
that concurrent chats are held by their own gates), the two terminal-command
targets, plus `session-start` and `continue-workflow` for their modern
`session_id`, and `record-human-turn` for the exact approval response. Every
other target touches neither channel and keeps its zero-latency path. The
approval floor runs on every `PreToolUse`; on 1.x its payload arrives and the
channel closes with the call, so the normal path does not wait, and only a
channel that never closes holds it until the ceiling. A 0.12 payload carries no
`session_id`, so the floor uses the identity derived from the IDE host
instance: every chat in that host shares it and is judged by the gates of the
workflow it is bound to.

The legacy environment variable name does not imply raw user text: the measured
0.12 contract is camelCase JSON. A promptSubmit payload without a `prompt`
field therefore advances only the legacy turn clock; the terminal utility is
recognized later from `toolArgs.command` on the matching preToolUse event. Raw
`/aidlc ...` text remains accepted for newer Kiro generations that expose it
directly, but is not the 0.12 compatibility claim.

`VSCODE_IPC_HOOK` / `VSCODE_PID` are also present in the IDE (absent on the
CLI). Legacy Plan Approval hashes those measured host-instance values into its
runtime session identity, so two IDE windows in one workspace do not share
challenge/response files. Other adapter routing still keys off the payload
channels above.

## Per-event captures

Result prose is identical on both channels (`toolResult` on 0.12,
`tool_response` on 1.x):

| Event | tool name | tool inputs | result prose | recoverable? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| UserPromptSubmit (1.0.242) | n/a | `{prompt:""}` | n/a | prompt: no; session id: yes |
| PreToolUse (shell, 1.0.242) | `execute_pwsh` | `{command,cwd,run_in_background,timeout}` | n/a | command: yes |
| PostToolUse (write) — create | `fs_write` | `{}` (empty) | `Created the <PATH> file.` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (write) — edit | `str_replace` | `{}` (empty) | `Replaced text in <PATH>` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (write) — append | `fs_append` | `{}` (empty) | `Appended the text to the <PATH> file.` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (shell) | `execute_bash` | `{}` (empty) | `Output:\n<stdout>\n\nExit Code: 0` | command: **not** recoverable (only stdout) |

When UserPromptSubmit carries a typed fence or Guard Policy switch, the adapter forwards it to the core human-turn hook, which applies it at prompt time under the payload session and returns an `AIDLC Guard Policy:` note; shell setters are not run inside the adapter.
On empty-prompt builds such as IDE 1.0.242, the per-turn `prompt-empty` marker makes the adapter refuse lowering shell commands (exit 2 with stderr), including environment-prefixed invocations and summary confirmation `off`, and `verb-intercept` emits a once-per-session capability note explaining that active work cannot be lowered on that build and directing the person to update to a prompt-capable IDE or start new work from a lower-default scope; for summary confirmation and for plan approval both also name the person's project-wide terminal command `<invoke> config flags --bypass AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION --local --yes` or `--bypass AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD` (`--clear-bypass` undoes it), which also works while the work runs. Raising to `strict` or turning a fence or summary confirmation `on` remains available.
Before forwarding an empty prompt, the adapter renames a sole retired
`Change Control: relaxed|off` line to `Guard Policy` automatically without
changing its value or source label and without a policy audit row. It prints
the migration note itself because some builds discard core hook output.

### Critical limitations

1. **PostToolUse write/shell captures have empty tool inputs** on both
   channels. Their written path must therefore be parsed from the result prose,
   and the shell command is absent (only stdout + exit code is present). This is
   not a universal IDE rule, and delivery is not uniform across generations:
   later 1.x builds populate some PreToolUse and delegation inputs (#543).
   Issue #763 reports that Kiro IDE 1.0.309 populated PreToolUse subagent
   dispatch with `prompt` and `explanation`, shell/write matchers with
   `command`, `cwd`, `run_in_background`, and `timeout`, and PostToolUse inputs
   as well. That 1.0.309 observation was reported, not measured in this
   repository; the measured base is the 0.12, 1.0.165, and 1.0.242 captures
   described above, plus the 1.1.14 PreToolUse captures under "Blocking a tool
   call" below.
2. **1.x carries no success flag.** Only the 0.12 channel's explicit boolean
   `toolSuccess: false` drops a well-formed write from the audit (#417); a 1.x
   payload with the field absent falls through to the path check. Because that
   channel cannot report failure structurally, a failed write on 1.x arrives
   only as error prose — so the adapter classifies before logging: prose
   RECOGNISED as a failure is sent to `hookDebug` (written only when hook
   debugging is enabled); there is no artifact to audit, so not forwarding it
   is correct, not decay. An unrecognised wording still records a visible
   hook-drop, which is the case that signals real degradation. On the legacy
   0.12 channel, explicit `toolSuccess: true` remains authoritative and bypasses
   failure-prose inference. A present non-null payload field with the wrong
   runtime type is treated as malformed:
   the advisory hook exits successfully, records a visible drop, and forwards no audit or subagent event. `null` is treated like
   an unavailable field, matching the channel's existing absent-value contract.
3. **Paths in the result prose are workspace-RELATIVE**, but the core hooks
   compare against an absolute record root — so the adapter resolves them to
   absolute before forwarding.

### Blocking a tool call (PreToolUse)

Measured live on Kiro IDE 1.1.14 (Windows) with probe hooks on `execute_pwsh`
and `fs_write`:

| Hook output | Tool call | What the model receives |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| reason on stderr, exit 2 | blocked, before Kiro's approval card | the stderr text, inside Kiro's "Tool ... was intercepted by PreToolUse hooks before execution" message, which says the tool was not executed |
| reason on stdout, exit 2 | runs, after the approval card | nothing from the hook |
| stdout and stderr, exit 2 | blocked | the stderr text only |
| reason on stderr, exit 1 | runs | nothing from the hook |
| `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` or `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` on stdout, exit 0 | runs | nothing from the hook |

So a refusal must put its whole reason on stderr and exit 2. Every adapter
route that refuses a tool call does, and a forwarded core hook's stderr is
relayed when it exits 2; stdout from a PreToolUse hook never reaches the model.
Several PreToolUse hooks run one after another in file-name order, every one
runs even after an earlier one blocks, and a block from a hook between two
others still delivers its reason. Kiro IDE shows one "Run Command Hook" card
for every hook run, so AI-DLC registers its five tool-call checks as one hook,
`aidlc-guard-tool-call`, which runs them as Kiro ran the separate hooks: in the
same order (`enforce-approval-gate`, `plan-approval-guard`, `review-freeze`,
`state-transition-guard`, `terminal-command-guard`), each for the tools its
own registration selected, every one even after an earlier one refuses. The
call is refused when any check refuses, with each refusal's text once and
nothing from a check that let it through (#2022). So `terminal-command-guard`
runs no terminal command while the approval gate is waiting for the person:
the gate check refuses the call, and the command would otherwise still act.
Its matcher leaves out only the reads in the adapter's tool-name table, which
cannot answer an approval or change the workspace; a name the table does not
know, such as Kiro's own background `memory` tool, still reaches the checks.
The two hooks after a shell command run the same way as one,
`aidlc-after-shell`. On 1.1.14 the PreToolUse `fs_write` input is
`{path, text}`, and the shell input matches the 1.0.242 row above.

## Consequences for each hook

- **write-audit-log / run-sensors** — recoverable: scrape the file path from
  the result prose, resolve to absolute, feed the core hooks the Claude-shaped
  `{tool_input:{file_path}}`. When no path can be extracted the adapter splits
  two cases rather than logging both: prose recognised as a **failed** write is
  sent to `hookDebug` (written only when hook debugging is enabled) and is not
  forwarded because no artifact exists; this inference runs only when the
  payload has no structured success flag. Explicit `toolSuccess: true` and any
  other unmatched wording record a visible hook-drop (never a silent no-op) —
  that is the invisible-decay case the drop log exists to surface. Conflating
  them made `--doctor` report degradation on healthy workspaces.
- **rebuild-stage-graph** — the shell command is unrecoverable, so the IDE path
  drops the command filter and gates purely on the audit tail (with an mtime
  idempotency guard so a lingering transition — e.g. after `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`
  — does not recompile on every subsequent shell command). The shell result and
  session identity are still forwarded: modern events use their exact
  `session_id`, while the legacy channel uses the host-derived identity retained
  by SessionStart. When the result names a successful `intent-create`, the shared
  hook binds that session to the created record.
- **sync-workflow-state** — the IDE gives no task payload, so it derives the current
  stage from the latest `STAGE_STARTED` in the audit tail. This is a
  **forward-only** mirror: it never rewinds `Current Stage` to a completed or
  skipped stage, and never fires when the workflow is not `Running` (guards
  against resurrecting a finished workflow). Both audit-tail hooks match
  `execute_bash`, Windows `execute_pwsh`, and the `shell` alias — the
  IDE surfaces no task event the sync could parse.
- **front gate for the two audit-tail hooks**: they run after every shell
  command, as the `aidlc-after-shell` card, so the dispatcher's
  `engine adapter kiro-ide` route looks first,
  without loading the engine (`core/tools/aidlc-hook-front-gate.ts`). When
  either hook finds nothing to do from a record's files it leaves
  `<hook>.noop` in that record's `.aidlc-engine/hooks-health/`. The gate skips
  the hook only when every record in every space carries that mark at least
  5 s newer than everything the hook reads there (audit shards and the state
  file, plus `runtime-graph.json` for the rebuild), and a skipped rebuild
  rewrites its existing `rebuild-stage-graph.last` heartbeat as the full hook
  would. A link, the flat layout from before spaces, hook debugging, a timestamp
  ahead of the clock, or a change within the margin runs the full hook. The
  card is skipped only when both hooks are. The guards, writes, prompts and
  every other target always run in full.
- **log-subagent** — payload-dependent. IDE 0.12 sent `invoke_sub_agent`; 1.x
  (1.0.89-1.0.138) sent `subagent_<agent>` instead, each preceded by an empty
  `subagent_response` shell (`"Response recorded."`). The registration matcher
  is therefore broad (`^(subagent_.+|invoke_sub_agent)$`) so every delegate name
  reaches the adapter, and the adapter drops `subagent_response` — that shell
  carries prose but no identity, so forwarding it would fabricate a
  `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` row with `Agent Type: unknown`. Identity prefers the
  structured 1.x `subagent_<agent>` tool name (#543) — it is platform-provided,
  so agent-authored result prose cannot misattribute the audit row — and falls
  back to the `**Reviewer:**` / `**Agent:**` result marker from #459, which is
  the only identity signal on the 0.12 `invoke_sub_agent` shape.
- **review-freeze / state-transition-guard**: each runs in the
  `aidlc-guard-tool-call` card with its own matcher, which names exactly the write and shell tools the adapter
  forwards (`write`, `fs_write`, `create_file`, `str_replace`, `fs_append`,
  `delete_file`, `apply_patch`, `edit_file`, `execute_bash`, `execute_pwsh`,
  `shell`), so a read, a search or a `memory` call reaches neither check. No
  payload of `create_file`, `apply_patch` or `edit_file` is captured: each is
  checked by the path fields the adapter reads, and one with none (a patch
  whose paths are only in its text) is refused as described below. A write tool the adapter recognizes is forwarded
  as Write (`fs_write`, `text` as `content`; the kiro-cli 2.6.1 `write`,
  `content` as is) or Edit (`fs_append`, `text` as
  `new_string`; `str_replace`, `oldStr`/`newStr` as `old_string`/`new_string`;
  `delete_file`, `targetFile` as the path), a shell tool as Bash judged from
  the call's own `cwd` (and from every directory a literal `cd` or `pushd` in
  the command leaves it in; `execute_pwsh` marked `aidlc_shell: "powershell"`,
  so both read it as PowerShell), and the payload `session_id` rides along; every other
  tool is not forwarded. Kiro
  runs project PreToolUse hooks on a delegated agent's own calls too, with the
  conductor's `session_id` and no agent identity, and honours exit 2 there
  (measured on IDE 1.2.4 over `invoke_sub_agent` with `fs_write`), so both
  guards judge a delegate's call as the conductor's. Every PreToolUse payload
  of the supported builds (Kiro IDE 1.1.70, Kiro CLI 2.24.1 and later) names
  its tool and fills its input, so a call neither guard can read (no payload,
  malformed fields, no tool name, a write tool with no path field the adapter reads, a
  shell tool with no command) is refused with exit 2 before either runs,
  whatever the workflow, Guard Policy or `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEW_FREEZE_HOOK`;
  the refusal names those builds and says to update an older Kiro. A legacy
  argument-less payload is one such call. A readable command that writes
  nothing is still forwarded.
- **plan-approval-guard** — populated PreToolUse arguments are forwarded to the
  shared target-aware guard, a shell call judged from its own `cwd` as above. Kiro IDE 0.12 identifies the tool but supplies an
  empty argument object, so the adapter uses a mediated planned-source protocol
  (this guard's own handling: on this row the review-freeze and
  state-transition registrations above refuse such a call, so the planning
  write it admits does not run, and a write window it opened stays a recovery
  latch as described below):
  only the measured `fs_write` and `str_replace` tools remain available while
  planning; shell, append, delete, patch, aliases, and custom mutation tools stop
  before approval. After a canonical plan write the adapter injects the current
  Testing Contract. After a canonical questions write it replaces the
  target-bound `[Approval Fingerprint]`, records the live workspace source as
  `[Planned Source]` (the legacy channel cannot run the fingerprint command, so
  the adapter owns both tags; `unbindable` when the workspace has no source
  fingerprint), and invokes the reserved decision or answer tool itself. Kiro
  discards PostToolUse stdout, so a successful write hook remains silent; when
  the decision or answer step is refused, the hook exits 2 with the refusal on
  stderr instead of dropping it, because the write window stays latched until
  the human recovers. Workspace source is checked against the recorded
  `[Planned Source]` exactly as the answer path checks it: before a planned
  source is recorded there is nothing to compare, and once one is recorded a
  drift blocks opaque tools with the remedy "re-present the plan" while the
  canonical planning writes stay open so that remedy can be executed.
  The invoking `next` or final steering `continue` carries one
  `legacy_plan_approval_choices` capability in its Code Generation directive.
  Runtime stores only its hashes, while the plaintext labels remain in that
  chat's tool result. The human's later `promptSubmit` must carry one exact
  label; unrelated prompts receive no capability. Ownership is global for the
  active intent/revision rather than looked up through the incoming session.
  Recovery is human-gated: the owning window first receives a typed recovery
  ask and must record the exact `Recover Plan Approval` response before a later
  `next` rotates any offer or challenge. Another live window is refused. A
  replacement window can request the same human recovery only after the
  recorded owner PID is gone, or after an IPC-only owner's endpoint disappears.
  Takeover rotates any pending challenge and clears its prior response. The
  shared questions file stays canonical and the audit redacts the choices.
  Missing or corrupt offer/challenge files do not make authority disappear:
  the pre-write window itself is an orphan-recovery latch if PostToolUse never
  arrives, and a matching write violation continues that latch when PostToolUse
  does run. Fresh publication remains blocked until the exact human recovery
  response. The adapter preserves a recovery ask and, after success, clears only
  the violation/write window rather than deleting the replacement offer. Before each
  write, a latch is created; authoritative `toolSuccess: false` and recognized
  failure prose clear it because no mutation occurred, while unknown outcomes
  retain it and require recovery.
  Before an argument-less planning write the adapter stores the current
  target/revision in a protected write window. If the write deletes or corrupts
  state, the active marker, or another authority file, PostToolUse poisons the saved revision and
  later mutation calls remain blocked even when live authority can no longer be
  parsed. Adapter-owned `next` recovery clears that poison only after the engine
  returns a valid non-error directive. Raw audit appends have no authority.
  Adapter-owned recovery and decision/answer mediation use the shared
  `aidlcEngineCommand` helper in `aidlc-runtime-paths.ts`, also used by the
  orchestrator's state child. Native mode resolves the compiled executable
  (honoring `AIDLC_COMPILED_EXECUTABLE`) and invokes `engine orchestrate
  next`/`continue` or `engine log decision`/`answer`. Source mode uses Bun's
  executable and an absolute path to `aidlc-orchestrate.ts` or `aidlc-log.ts`.
  Both modes preserve the existing project/session arguments, working
  directory, and inherited environment. A failed child call retains its actual
  error; invalid JSON or an error directive does not clear the recovery latch.
  A new stage attempt retires the approval; a fresh directive for the same target
  and attempt does not. Generation start re-baselines the source the plan is bound
  to, and refuses rather than deletes if the workspace source moved first.
  Shared `ask_type: "guard-recovery"` directives have a separate contract from
  the legacy `Recover Plan Approval` capability handshake: follow the selected
  remedy's `interaction`, run a `command` exactly as returned after the required
  human choice, and collect separate exact feedback for a `human-input` Request
  Changes remedy. Native restart/abort commands come from structured operations;
  native abort receives the Plan Approval prerequisite exception only in the
  exact emitted argument shape. Owning tools still enforce lifecycle admission.
  See [Guard admission and recovery asks](12-state-machine.md#guard-admission-and-recovery-asks).
- **session-start** — reads the modern `session_id` and persists it under the
  gitignored runtime session directory; the legacy channel derives a stable
  per-host-instance ID from `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK`/`VSCODE_PID`. Kiro IDE 1.1.14
  (checked live on Windows) runs no SessionStart hook in a new chat, so the
  record-human-turn route below does this work for the chat's first prompt.
- **terminal commands** — newer builds that expose the submitted `/aidlc ...`
  prompt run deterministic utilities at UserPromptSubmit. IDE 1.0.242 exposes
  an empty prompt, so the fallback recognizes the exact `execute_pwsh`
  `aidlc-orchestrate.ts next` call at PreToolUse, runs the classified utility
  once, and refuses the duplicate shell call. Both routes hand the utility the
  event's `session_id` as its session, so `/aidlc intent <name>` or
  `/aidlc space <name>` binds the chat that typed it even when this hook runs
  before record-human-turn has started that chat. Both routes decode UTF-8
  explicitly and remove terminal protocol/control bytes only from the
  plain-text relay; structured hook JSON and unrelated refusal paths are not
  rewritten. Modern turn/latch state is keyed by a hash of `session_id`, so
  concurrent chats cannot reuse one another's output; payloads without a
  session identity use the host-derived identity or the retained session, with
  an explicit legacy bucket when neither is available. The 0.12 camelCase
  fallback reads the command from `toolArgs.command`.
- **cmd.exe metacharacters**: native Windows `aidlc` is `aidlc.cmd`, so cmd.exe
  reads the command line Windows PowerShell 5.1 builds for it: a value holding
  a space is wrapped in double quotes with its own double quotes left as they
  are, and cmd.exe acts on `&`, `|`, `<`, `>` and `^` outside its quotes. So
  `--details 'Use "R & D" team'`, or the same with `\"`, runs `D" team"` as a
  separate command. Before anything else, `terminal-command-guard` refuses
  (exit 2 with the reason on stderr) an `execute_pwsh` call of `aidlc` or
  `aidlc.cmd` in which one of those characters would reach cmd.exe outside its
  quotes, or in which a value holds a `%NAME%` pair (cmd.exe replaces it with
  that environment variable's value, even inside its quotes; a lone `%` passes,
  and so does a pair whose name would start or end with a space, such as the
  one in `10% and 20%`). The reason is a fixed sentence that names the flag
  whose value is at fault (or "A value") and the character or "a %NAME% pair",
  and never repeats the value, so text in a value cannot add lines to it. It
  simulates PowerShell 5.1's argument passing (an empty argument dropped, a
  value with a space or tab wrapped in double quotes) and cmd.exe's quote
  toggling, reading past a `#` comment and a closed `<# ... #>` block comment,
  and joining a line that ends in a backtick continuation (CRLF, LF or CR) to
  the next. Statements inside `(...)`, `$(...)`, `@(...)`, `@{...}` and
  `{...}` groupings are read too, nested or not, so an `aidlc` call such as
  `(aidlc engine orchestrate next 2>$null | Select-Object -Last 1)` is
  checked like any other; a `$(...)` inside a double-quoted string is not.
  Redirects (`2>$null`, `*>$null`, `>$null`, `2>&1`, `> file`) are never
  `aidlc` values. A person's words that PowerShell resolves before
  `aidlc.cmd` runs are refused as well, because the check cannot see what
  reaches cmd.exe. That is the value of `--details`, `--decision`,
  `--rationale`, `--reason`, `--user-input`, `--feedback`, `--override` or
  `--arguments`, or the request after `next`, given as a variable such as `$x`
  or `$env:X`, an expression such as `$(...)`, or a double-quoted string
  holding `$` or a backtick. The reason says the value comes from a
  PowerShell variable or expression and asks for the value itself in single
  quotes. A variable for any other flag or for a positional token, such as
  the receipt in `continue $obj.receipt`, passes, unless its own text holds a
  metacharacter or a `%NAME%` pair; so does a variable in any other command.
  A statement it cannot
  read to the end (one using the `--%` stop-parsing token, or one holding an
  unterminated quote or block comment) is refused when its program is `aidlc`
  or `aidlc.cmd`, bare, by path, or after `&` or `.`, as far as the words
  before that point show; a statement running any other program passes, even
  when it mentions aidlc as data. `bun .kiro/tools/...` calls and other
  programs are not checked.
- **stop** — reads the modern Stop event's `session_id` and prefers it over the
  workspace-global SessionStart marker, so concurrent chats consume only their
  own post-create and post-switch handoff receipts. Legacy agentStop and broken
  modern channels fall back to the retained identity.
- **record-human-turn** — reads the modern `session_id` and answer payload, or
  the legacy `USER_PROMPT`; it can submit an exact directive-issued choice but
  never reveals, rotates, or transfers another chat's protected capability.
  When the prompt's `session_id` is not the one retained from the last event,
  or the adapter has no record of starting that session, the adapter runs the
  core session-start first (`resume` when it started the session before or the
  session already has a binding or intent stamp, else `startup`) and prints its
  context ahead of the prompt hook's own, so a new chat still gets its
  `AIDLC Runtime Session:` line and switching back to an earlier chat rebinds
  it. The record is a `session-started` file in the
  session's hashed turn/latch directory, written only after session-start
  succeeds, from this route or from a SessionStart hook that did run. The
  retained id alone is no evidence of a start: earlier adapters retained every
  prompt's id without starting it, so a chat open across the upgrade starts on
  its next prompt. A later prompt from a started, retained session starts
  nothing.
- **session-end / block** — need no payload and never read stdin. Session-end
  reuses the identity persisted by SessionStart, with the legacy lifecycle
  fallback retained only where no approval authority is involved.

## toolResult path-extraction patterns

| toolName | wording | canonical tool |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `fs_write` | `Created the <PATH> file.` | Write |
| `str_replace` | `Replaced text in <PATH>` (may carry a trailing ` (N occurrences)`) | Edit |
| `fs_append` | `Appended the text to the <PATH> file.` | Edit |

The extractor trims trailing whitespace/newlines before matching and strips a
trailing parenthetical from the `str_replace` form. `fs_write` maps to `Write`;
`str_replace`/`fs_append` map to `Edit` (both target an existing file → the core
write-audit-log records `ARTIFACT_UPDATED`).
