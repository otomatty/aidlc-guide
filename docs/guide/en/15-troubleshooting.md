# Troubleshooting

This chapter covers common issues and their solutions, organized by symptom.

> **Harness note.** Symptoms and fixes below are written for **Claude Code** (hook
> filenames, `settings.json` blocks, compaction behaviour). The deterministic core
> — state, audit, the engine — behaves identically on every harness, but the
> shell-level surfaces differ: the other harnesses wire hooks and config their own way
> (see [Running on other harnesses](harnesses/README.md)). Where a fix names a
> `.claude/` path or a Claude mechanic, the equivalent lives in your harness's
> config dir.

## Quick Fix Table

| Symptom | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| No audit entries appearing | Run `aidlc doctor`; for a copy install, also verify `bun` is on the hook PATH |
| I edited a file by hand; will the agent accept it? | Yes: edit, then say **done** (or carry on). An edit to a finished stage is used as is but not re-approved; to have it approved, jump back with `/aidlc --stage <name>`, which reopens that stage and every stage after it. See [Editing Files Yourself](07-interaction-modes.md#editing-files-yourself) for each case |
| Claude hooks are restricted by policy | Ask the Claude Code administrator to lift managed `allowManagedHooksOnly`; project settings cannot override it |
| Cursor: approvals are never recorded | If the project is not in a git repository, run `git init` in it, then fully restart Cursor and trust the folder (see [Cursor project outside a git repository](#cursor-project-outside-a-git-repository)) |
| Kiro IDE: `deny fs_read matching ".kiro/"` | Run `/aidlc --doctor`; remove the `.kiro/` rule from the ignore file it names (see [Kiro IDE Read Denials](#kiro-ide-read-denials)) |
| Kiro IDE: the agent cites "my memory" and suggests bypassing a check or running a hook by hand | Ignore it and delete that Kiro memory (see [Kiro memories carry old AI-DLC advice](harnesses/kiro-ide.md#kiro-memories-carry-old-ai-dlc-advice)) |
| State file corrupted | Run `/aidlc --doctor`, compare against state template |
| Stuck at approval gate | Type your response; use `/aidlc --stage <target>` to jump past it |
| Kiro IDE: your reply to an approval question is not seen, or commands come back with exit code -1 | Choose **Trust Folder & Continue** when Kiro asks whether you trust this folder (or select **Manage**, then **Trust**, on the Restricted Mode banner), then run **Developer: Reload Window** from the Command Palette and say carry on; if your next message is still not recorded, `/aidlc --doctor` shows why. In Kiro CLI, quit and start `kiro-cli` again in the folder (see [Kiro IDE hooks not running](#kiro-ide-hooks-not-running)) |
| Kiro CLI (or a Kiro ACP client): every approval says no human reply has arrived, and restarting does not help | The engine does not match the distribution: `kiro` needs Kiro CLI's v2 engine, `kiro-ide` needs v3 (see [Kiro CLI hooks not running](#kiro-cli-hooks-not-running)) |
| Context compacted mid-session | Run `/aidlc` to resume from checkpoint |
| Audit log too large | Leave it where it is: a long project's audit file is large by design, and the engine reads it to know what you approved and finished (see [Audit Log Growing Too Large](#audit-log-growing-too-large)) |
| Hooks appear to hang | Diagnose lock ownership with `/aidlc --doctor`; see [Lock Files Left Behind](#lock-files-left-behind) |
| Statusline shows "ready" | Check `aidlc-state.md` has a `**Lifecycle Phase**` field |
| Statusline not appearing | Run `aidlc doctor`; for a copy install, verify `bun` is on PATH |
| Subagent timed out | Run `/aidlc` to retry or run the stage inline |
| Workflow stuck or misbehaving, need help | Run `/aidlc --doctor --export` and share the produced `.tar.gz` (redacted; no work product) |
| A Bolt attempt was set aside | Ask the assistant to invoke the saved abort result's `restore_operation` with its exact argv; hints are display-only. Evidence-only attempts have no saved files to restore. See [getting the files back](#a-bolt-attempt-was-set-aside-getting-the-files-back) |

## Native Install Channel

| Symptom or error | Resolution |
|------------------|------------|
| `Checksum mismatch for <asset>.` or `<asset>: checksum mismatch` | Stop. Do not reuse the downloaded directory. Download the complete release asset set and `checksums.txt` again from the same release. |
| `command not found: aidlc` after `install.sh` | Add the installer-reported bin directory to `PATH` (normally `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`), open a new shell, and run `aidlc doctor`. |
| `aidlc` is not recognized after `install.ps1` | The default install registers User PATH for the account that ran PowerShell. If another session cannot find it, open a new terminal; restart the terminal app or IDE if needed. With [`-NoModifyPath`](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#windows-powershell), use the printed direct command (normally `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\aidlc\bin\aidlc.cmd" config`) or rerun the installer without that switch to register PATH. |
| `aidlc` works in PowerShell or CMD but not in Git Bash (or another MSYS shell) | Those shells resolve a command with Unix `execvp` rules and ignore `PATHEXT`, so a bare `aidlc` never finds `aidlc.cmd`. The installer writes an extensionless `aidlc` launcher beside `aidlc.cmd` in the bin directory (normally `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\bin`) precisely so the bare name resolves in these shells; if it is missing, rerun the installer or `aidlc use <version>` (from PowerShell or CMD, where `aidlc` already resolves) to rewrite it. One known cause of a hook that `/hooks` lists as registered yet never fires on Windows is this: the hook shell cannot resolve `aidlc`. `aidlc doctor` shows it as a failed `Windows launcher (Git Bash)` row that names the step to take. **If a file named `aidlc` that AI-DLC did not write (for example an earlier hand-made forwarder) is already in that bin directory, the installer, `aidlc update` and `aidlc use` ask once at a terminal whether to replace it, and keep your file as `aidlc.bak-<time>` beside it. `--yes` (`-Yes` for the installer) answers yes. Without a terminal or `--yes`, they leave the file as it is and say to move it aside. A directory named `aidlc` there is never replaced: remove or rename it, then rerun the installer or `aidlc use <version>`.** |
| `This PowerShell window is running as administrator` | For the safest install, answer N, open PowerShell normally (not "Run as administrator"), and run the installer again. To continue as administrator anyway, answer y, or pass `-Yes` to the installer. `aidlc uninstall` asks nothing: it prints the same warning and goes ahead, so for the safest uninstall run it from a normal PowerShell window. AI-DLC is per-user and does not need admin rights. The built-in Administrator on Windows Server and other sessions without UAC elevation see no warning. |
| Windows install reports a PATH conflict | The files are installed, but persistent PATH selects another command. Use the printed full command path for `config`, or resolve the reported conflict. JSON reports `status: "warning"` and `data.ready: false` even though the exit code is 0. |
| Windows install reports that it could not configure PATH | The files are installed; the PATH step failed with exit code 1. Follow the printed recovery instruction, or rerun with `-NoModifyPath` and use the direct command. JSON reports `data.installed: true` and `data.ready: false`. |
| User PATH entry remains after Windows uninstall | Uninstall removes only an entry owned through `windows-path.json`. A pre-existing entry or an install without that ownership record leaves User PATH unchanged. See [Uninstall](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#uninstall). |
| Files remain after uninstall | Uninstall deletes individually verified files and removes directories only when empty. Unlisted or changed files are preserved and reported, including files without an ownership inventory in older installs. Review the reported paths; `--purge` does not delete unrelated content. |
| `--offline requires --from <release-directory>` | Offline mode never falls back to a network release. Transfer the complete release asset set, then pass its directory with `--from` / `-From`; the installer verifies it. |
| `aidlc.cmd` exits 4 or the Windows active pointer is invalid | The launcher prints one `aidlc:` line naming the file it could not use (the active version marker, the active command target, or the active executable) followed by `Rerun the AI-DLC installer (install.ps1) to repair the aidlc command.` After `aidlc update` from an earlier release, that release's launcher, which exits 4 without printing anything, stays until the next `aidlc` command other than `aidlc doctor` or `aidlc uninstall` replaces it; that one command still runs through the old launcher, which splits a value with spaces into separate words. While it is there, `aidlc doctor` shows a `Windows launcher` row; when AI-DLC cannot replace it (for example because `aidlc.cmd` or `aidlc-shim.ps1` was changed after install), the row says why and names the step that fixes it. If the old launcher exits 4 before any command starts, rerun the installer. Do not edit `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\active-executable`. Rerun the same verified installer or use `aidlc use <version>` from a working retained executable. A line that says PowerShell runs the launcher in `ConstrainedLanguage` mode means an application control policy (AppLocker or WDAC) blocks it: ask your administrator to allow `aidlc-shim.ps1`, or run `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\versions\<version>\aidlc.exe` directly. |
| `aidlc-shim.ps1 cannot be loaded` or `is not digitally signed` | A Group Policy execution policy overrides the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` that `aidlc.cmd` passes, so PowerShell refuses the launcher before it runs. Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`: a `MachinePolicy` or `UserPolicy` row other than `Undefined` is the cause. Ask your administrator to allow the script, or run `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\versions\<version>\aidlc.exe` directly. |
| `pending Windows uninstall` or a Windows uninstall recovery failure | Close active AI-DLC commands and run `aidlc doctor`. A pending cleanup resumes on the next command. If doctor reports a failed cleanup, resolve the reason it shows and run `aidlc uninstall` again by the full path doctor prints (normally `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\aidlc\bin\aidlc.cmd" uninstall`, since the PATH entry may already be gone; add `--purge` if the original used it): a cleanup that failed before removing files is planned again from disk, and one that had begun resumes. If that command no longer runs, run the installer again; it retries the pending cleanup first, so you may need to run it twice. Older or altered journals without a bound file plan are refused; keep the temp journal, cleanup script, machine fence, and remaining files for inspection. |
| `a Windows uninstall cleanup is still running` | A cleanup worker was launched in the last few minutes. Wait for it to finish, then rerun the command. |
| Alpine reports missing `libstdc++.so.6` or `libgcc_s.so.1` | Install the same runtime dependencies required by Bun's and Node.js's musl builds with `apk add libgcc libstdc++`, then rerun the installer or command. Fully static Bun musl compile targets are not available today; the installer reports this remediation but does not install packages. |
| `Providers` shows `[needs]` with `no recorded answers` although the harness already has its own model access | On Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE the row reads `[ok]` and `aidlc config providers` asks nothing, because model access comes with Kiro. On GitHub Copilot and Cursor the row reads `[ok]` with no answer, because the session brings model access; run `aidlc config providers` only to use your own Amazon Bedrock access (on Cursor, only the IDE takes Bedrock keys; its CLI always uses Cursor's backend). On every other harness the row is genuine: answer `amazon-bedrock`, or choose `keep current` (`--provider current`) to preserve and record the provider already configured for the harness. `--provider other --acknowledge` records a different provider you configured yourself. |
| `Models` shows `[needs]` with `no recorded policy` | With no policy, most agents inherit your session's model and effort, so a session at high effort runs them at high effort. Record a preset to set agent efforts (`aidlc config models --preset balanced --project --yes`), or leave it to keep inheriting. On Kiro CLI a preset sets one effort for the whole session: `aidlc config models` chooses the session model and saves it with that effort in your personal Kiro settings, and `/model` and `/effort` change them inside Kiro (see [Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort)). On GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Kiro IDE the row reads `[ok]` and names the host instead, because those hosts cannot pin an agent's model or effort: choose them in the host. See [Choosing a Model and Effort](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#choosing-a-model-and-effort). |
| `workspace shell ready` fails in `aidlc doctor` and rerunning `aidlc config` does not fix it | The interactive rerun uses the existing projection and never rebuilds a missing `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`; while the shell is incomplete it reports a `Workspace` row and offers no sections to fix. Run the command that row names. On a native install that is `aidlc config --harness <name>`, which refreshes from the installed runtime and recreates the workspace shell. A Bun-invoking projection, copied from the `runtime/<name>/` root of `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` or from a checkout's `dist/<name>/` tree, has no installed runtime to refresh from, so its command also carries `--download`, which fetches and verifies `aidlc-copy-runtime-<version>.tar.gz` for the project's release. It never uses the native `aidlc-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` or `dist-release/` bytes, which would swap the project's hooks to the native command. |
| `aidlc config` says it needs a release: `this project is pinned to <version>`, `needs the <version> release files`, `is missing aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`, or `no longer has the MCP server list` | The project needs files for a release this machine does not have: a teammate's newer pin, a harness you are adding, or files it lost. Run the `fix:` line: it is your command with `--download`, which fetches exactly that release, verifies its checksum and (when `gh` is installed) its release attestation, and finishes the command. Natively that installs and registers the pinned release, as `aidlc config --pin` does; on a copied project it downloads `aidlc-copy-runtime-<version>.tar.gz`. At a terminal config asks instead. A pinned release already installed is used without asking. Without network access, follow the `offline:` line: fetch the named file elsewhere and pass it with `--from`, or natively `aidlc config --pin <version> --offline --from <release directory>`. `--release-base-url` and `--ca-bundle` choose a mirror. A failed checksum or attestation stops with nothing changed. |
| `aidlc doctor` asks for Bun on a project you did not install through the copy channel | Copy-channel projections run hooks through Bun; native installs run them through the `aidlc` command. The remediation names which channel the project is on. To stop needing Bun, reinstall through the native release installer and rerun `aidlc config --harness <name>`. |
| `Harness trees on different releases` in `aidlc doctor` | The project's harness trees were installed from different releases, so a workflow can behave differently in each tool. Run the commands the row names. A pinned project's trees are brought to the pin. Natively that is `aidlc config --harness <name>` for each tree not on the engine's release (or the pin). On a pinned copied project it is `bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc.ts config --harness <name> --download`; without a pin it is `bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc.ts config --harness <name> --from <file>` with the newest tree's `aidlc-copy-runtime-<version>.tar.gz`, after one `--download` refresh for a tree no config run has recorded. Open work carries on through the refresh, so there is no need to wait for it to finish. |
| `config plan changed after approval` | Rerun `aidlc config --dry-run --json`, review `data.actions`, and apply the new `data.planToken` with exactly the same source and behavior options. |
| `locally modified` or `managed block was locally modified` from `aidlc config` | Run `aidlc config --dry-run --json` and review `data.actions`. Use `--force` only to replace baseline-owned framework bytes or managed blocks; it never authorizes unrelated root content. `.claude/settings.json` is merged by entry, so it does not need `--force`: a refresh puts back AI-DLC's hooks and command allow entries and keeps your hooks, deny rules, custom statusline, environment, and other settings, with a note saying what it put back. Retired shipped allow entries are not removed automatically. `.codex/config.toml` is merged by entry the same way: a refresh changes only AI-DLC's own keys, keeps your keys, tables and comments as they are, and keeps a value you changed in one of AI-DLC's keys, with a note when the release ships a different one. |
| `AI-DLC files: N changed in this project` in `aidlc doctor` | Those AI-DLC files were edited in this project, so `aidlc config` keeps them and stops before it refreshes anything. To keep your version, move the named files somewhere else, then run `aidlc config`; to take the shipped versions over them, run `aidlc config --force`. A file whose only difference is its line endings (a Windows checkout turns LF into CRLF) is never counted. |
| `cannot coexist in one project` | The second harness shares an engine directory (`opencode` / `copilot` use `.aidlc`) or an exclusive managed block (Copilot's `AGENTS.md`). Choose distinct engine directories and avoid exclusive blocks. `kiro` and `kiro-ide` also share `.kiro`, but `aidlc config --harness kiro-ide` (or `--harness kiro`) switches an installed one to the other in place; see [More than one harness in a project](18-install-and-lifecycle.md). The neutral `AGENTS.md` block is shared across Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode; `.gitignore` combines shipped entries. |
| `cannot switch .kiro from <row> to <row>: installed <row> has no ownership baseline`, `has an ownership baseline recorded before it listed only shipped files`, or `has an unusable ownership baseline` | Nothing usable records which `.kiro/` files the installed row owns, so the switch would leave its files behind; it changes nothing. Follow the printed steps: move a damaged `.kiro/tools/data/aidlc-manifest.json` aside (the step names its full path), run the printed `config --harness <installed row>`, then run the switch again. |
| `switching .kiro to kiro-ide lets Kiro run hook files AI-DLC does not own` | Kiro runs every `.kiro/hooks/*.json` file on its v3 engine and in Kiro IDE. Review the named files, then answer the prompt in a terminal, or run the printed `--dry-run` and apply the switch with the `--plan-token` it prints. `config plan changed after approval` or `hook files AI-DLC does not own changed after this switch was planned` means the set changed after review; review it again. |
| `cannot switch .kiro to kiro-ide: .kiro/hooks is a link or a file, not a directory`, or `Kiro would run hooks through entries that are not regular files in .kiro/hooks` | Make `.kiro/hooks` a real directory holding its files; or replace each listed hook entry (a link, a directory, or another non-file) with a regular file or move it out of `.kiro/hooks`. Then run the switch again. |
| `predates shared onboarding` | The named installed harness is older than the selected release (or has no valid recorded version) and its block is not shared. A preview sorts before the stable release with the same base version. Try refreshing it with `aidlc config --harness <name>` before adding another harness that shares the neutral `AGENTS.md` block. This is a hint for an older sibling: if it still refuses afterwards, its block is exclusive and they cannot coexist in one project. Copilot's block stays exclusive after refresh. Current exclusive blocks instead report `cannot coexist in one project`. `--force` does not bypass this compatibility check. |
| `refusing to refresh <harness> from a release whose AGENTS.md is not shared` | Another installed harness shares the neutral root block, but the selected refresh source does not declare it shared. Use a release that declares `AGENTS.md` shared; `--force` does not bypass this guard, and no project files are changed. |
| `shared block is owned by <harness> from a different release` | The shared `AGENTS.md` block matches the named sibling's baseline, not the selected release. Follow the refresh order in the error: refresh the selected harness from the same release as its sibling, or refresh the sibling from the selected release first. No project files are changed by the refused refresh. |
| `multiple project harnesses are present; pass one --harness <name>` | Every `aidlc config` on a multi-harness project must name the target with `--harness <name>`, except recording or clearing a bypass (`aidlc config flags --bypass <NAME>` or `--clear-bypass <NAME>` with nothing else to change), which belongs to the project and needs no harness. |
| `.gitignore` shows `preserve (owned by <harness>)` (`action: "preserve"`, `detail: "owned by <harness>"` in `aidlc config --dry-run --json`) | This fallback appears when the owning harness was installed by a release without `tools/data/root-blocks/`. Run `aidlc config --harness <owner>` to refresh it, after which both harnesses converge on one combined block. |
| `managed block has no ownership baseline` | The block was written by an install that no longer exists or has no baseline, for example a removed harness tree. Review `aidlc config --dry-run --json`, then use `--force` to replace it with the current shipped block (the combined entries for a shared `.gitignore`). |
| `has no readable projection descriptor` or `has lost its projection descriptor and ownership baseline` | Repair the named installed harness with `aidlc config --harness <name>` before adding another harness. For co-owned blocks, a same-release refresh is allowed when the source declares the block shared and leaves the current block unchanged, matching the sibling's baseline, even when that sibling's descriptor is missing; this allows both missing descriptors to be repaired one harness at a time. Otherwise, a `co-owns AGENTS.md` refusal requires restoring the named sibling's descriptor first; `--force` cannot bypass this guard. A stamped sibling (`aidlc-stamp.json` present) that has lost both its descriptor and its baseline blocks a refresh that would change a non-union managed block with `has lost its projection descriptor and ownership baseline`; restore that sibling first. A same-release refresh that leaves the current block unchanged is still allowed, but `--force` cannot permit a block-changing refresh. Legacy trees without a stamp and without baseline evidence of co-ownership can still be adopted one harness at a time. |
| `is missing its shipped block copy` | The named harness's install lost `tools/data/root-blocks/<marker>`. Run `aidlc config --harness <name>` to restore it, then rerun the refresh. `--force` writes the block without that harness's entries. |
| `unowned whole file` from an ordinary `aidlc config` release refresh | Move or merge the existing file manually before refresh. OpenCode's `opencode.json` no longer stops here: config adds AI-DLC's entries to your file and keeps everything else in it. |
| `opencode.json` stops config with `<key> must be a JSON object` or `must be a JSON array` | AI-DLC adds its entries to `skills.paths`, `instructions`, and `permission`; when one of those has another shape (for example `"permission": "ask"`), config changes nothing. Write it as a map or a list (`"permission": { "bash": "ask" }`), then rerun config. |
| `legacy root integration ambiguous; move or delete the unmarked AI-DLC content` | Reconcile the unmarked AI-DLC content in the named root file (such as `AGENTS.md`), preserving project-owned text, then rerun `aidlc config`. Unmarked `.gitignore` content is preserved and a fresh managed block appended; no rename or deletion is needed, and a rule that hides committed records gets a warning. See [Root Integrations and Ownership](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#root-integrations-and-ownership). |
| `gitignore is not valid UTF-8` | Back up `.gitignore` and convert it from its current encoding to UTF-8, preserving the ignore patterns, then rerun config. AI-DLC leaves the original bytes untouched when decoding would lose information. |
| `managed markers are missing, duplicated, or malformed` | Repair the named root file so it has exactly one matching `BEGIN AI-DLC` / `END AI-DLC` pair, or remove the broken AI-DLC block and rerun `aidlc config`. |
| `project runtime <version> is incompatible with selected engine <version>` | Run `aidlc use <version>` to install and select the compatible version, or refresh the project intentionally with `aidlc config`. |
| `this project requires <version>, which is not installed completely` | Install or reinstall the exact strict-semver pin with `aidlc config --pin <version>`. The dispatcher fails closed instead of falling back to the active machine version; use `aidlc config --unpin` only when the team intends to stop pinning the project. |
| `.aidlc-version must contain one release version id` | The committed pin file holds something other than one release id, such as extra text or a stray command. `aidlc config` and the dispatcher refuse it without printing its contents. Fix the file to the intended release id (for example `2.10.0`), or run `aidlc config --unpin` to stop pinning the project. |
| `AI-DLC can't run in <folder>. Start the session from your project's folder.` when you ask for AI-DLC | The session started in a folder that holds AI-DLC's machine install or command directory, such as your home folder, or in a folder inside one. AI-DLC does not run there, so its hooks stand aside and your other work in that folder goes on as usual. Start the session from your project's folder to use AI-DLC. |
| An update was interrupted and `aidlc version` still shows the prior release | This is the safe restored state: the old command remains active. Run `aidlc doctor`, then rerun the same `aidlc update --version <version>` command. |
| `another AI-DLC mutation holds .../.aidlc-transaction.lock`, `cannot verify` a lock, or `belongs to another host or boot` | Let an active owner finish; otherwise follow [Transaction lock ownership](#transaction-lock-ownership). |
| `an earlier AI-DLC command stopped before it finished, so its lock was cleared` | Nothing to do for the command you ran. The earlier command did not finish: rerun it if you still need it. |
| `another AI-DLC command is still changing this machine's install, so this ran on aidlc <version> without waiting for it to finish` | Nothing to do: a command or hook in a pinned project waited up to 30 seconds for an update, uninstall, or other machine change, then ran on its pinned release anyway. If it repeats while no other `aidlc` command is running, follow [Transaction lock ownership](#transaction-lock-ownership). |
| `EMLINK` (`too many links`), `Cannot create an AI-DLC transaction lock`, or `Cannot use the filesystem at ...` during config | Hard links have an automatic fallback; other filesystem requirements still apply. See [Config fails with a hard-link error](#config-fails-with-a-hard-link-error). |
| `existing aidlc is managed by Homebrew` / `Nix`, or the destination command is `not owned by the AI-DLC installer` | Upgrade through the reported owner. To keep a separate native install, set `AIDLC_BIN_DIR` explicitly to an empty user-owned directory. This release does not itself ship Homebrew or Nix packaging and never replaces a mixed-ownership command. |
| `update cache is invalid` or machine settings are rejected | Run `aidlc system config global list`. Repair or remove only the named `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\aidlc.settings.json` (Windows) or `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/aidlc/aidlc.settings.json` (macOS/Linux); unknown keys and stored credentials are rejected. |
| `HTTPS_PROXY must use HTTP or HTTPS` or a release URL is rejected | Use an HTTP(S) proxy URL and an HTTPS release mirror without credentials, query, or fragment. The native client reads `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`, not `HTTP_PROXY`, and redacts secret-like URL parts in errors. |
| Download fails behind a corporate CA | Pass `--ca-bundle <absolute-path>` or set `AIDLC_CA_BUNDLE`. The Windows bootstrap requires `curl.exe` when a custom CA is supplied. |
| `host inventory unavailable` from a plugin command | Run sync from a host session that injects the current plugin root, or restore the Claude/Codex host registry. Missing or malformed inventory is never treated as proof that content is safe to prune. |
| `cannot sync <plugin>` or `cannot prune <plugin>: owned path changed since composition` | You edited a file the plugin added. To keep the edit, move that file somewhere else, then run the same `aidlc engine plugin sync` (or `sync --prune-missing`) again; sync puts the plugin's own version back. `--yes` does not override ownership hashes. |
| `aidlc system versions prune`, `uninstall`, or plugin prune requires `--yes` | The command is running without an interactive stdin. Review the listed removals, then rerun with `--yes`; integrity refusals cannot be bypassed. At a terminal these commands ask nothing: they print what they remove, then do it. |
| `aidlc setup` is unknown, or an npm install is unavailable | Those channels are planned but not shipped. Use the release installer plus `aidlc config`; do not treat proposal transcripts as available commands. |

Native `aidlc doctor` also checks the active command pointer, rollback
eligibility, retained pin completeness, stale pin registrations, abandoned
transaction staging, project version skew, and whether binary-channel host
hooks and permission/trust entries consistently select the native command.

### Config warns about an ignore rule hiding committed records

In a Git repository, config checks whether one of your own ignore rules hides
records meant to be committed and shared. A rule such as `aidlc/` does, so
config still finishes but ends with a note naming `<file>:<line>` and the
hidden record paths (`memory/**`, `codekb/**`, `intents.json`, `aidlc-state.md`,
and `audit/*.md`): new ones will not reach teammates, though files git already
tracks keep being committed. The first-run setup and `--quiet` show it too.
If that is not what you intended, narrow the named rule, preserving unrelated
ignores. A deliberate rule, such as one keeping a personal scratch space out of
Git, can stay. Outside Git, or without the Git executable, there is no check.

### Config fails with a hard-link error

`aidlc config` first attempts a hard-link transaction lock. If the mount rejects
it with `EMLINK`, `ENOTSUP`, `EOPNOTSUPP`, `ENOSYS`, or `EPERM`, config automatically
tries a directory lock at the same `.aidlc-transaction.lock` path. No flag is
needed, and config never proceeds with unlocked writes.

The first-run wizard probes the required filesystem operations before offering
setup choices, then removes its temporary probe files. A failed probe stops
setup with nothing written; if a probe itself cannot be removed, setup names
it and says nothing else was written. Human output names the failure and the fix;
`--quiet` prints the fix, and `--json` returns a structured failure. Passing
probes cannot certify atomicity or crash durability. See the capabilities and
support matrix in [Transactions and Recovery](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#transactions-and-recovery).
An S3 mount name or hard-link error alone does not identify its driver, version,
or options.

For an incompatible mount, move or clone the project onto compatible local
storage, such as ext4 or XFS on an EC2 EBS volume, and rerun `aidlc config` there.
Keep the working project outside the S3 mount; any later upload is a separate
publication, without an atomic multi-file guarantee. An alias or symlink to the
same mount does not change its capabilities. Neither `--force`, `--from`, nor
deleting locks repairs missing filesystem semantics.

### Transaction lock ownership

Let a live init/lifecycle owner finish before retrying. The next AI-DLC
command clears a lock whose owner has stopped and says so in one line. An owner
has stopped when its PID is dead, or when the system has since given that PID
to a later process (Windows reuses PIDs quickly): one whose start record
differs from the one the lock recorded, or, for a lock from a release that
recorded none, one that started after the lock was written. A directory lock
also needs its recorded host/boot identity to match. Foreign, incomplete, or
unverifiable directory owners are retained; a PID absent on this host is not
proof that a foreign owner has stopped.

For manual diagnosis, preserve the error, lock, and named staging/recovery
paths. Inspect `.aidlc-transaction.lock/owner.json` (the lock file itself for a
legacy file lock), and establish the owner process, host/boot, and mount history
with the operator. All participants must share the same local temporary
directory (`TMPDIR` on Unix) and PID namespace. Stop writers before corrective
work and retain the evidence while ownership is uncertain. Do not blindly
delete the project lock or its local coordination gate to make a retry proceed.

## Hooks Not Firing

**Symptom**: No entries appearing in the intent's `audit/` shards after file writes, or no subagent completion logs.

### Native runtime versus source-generated Bun projection

The source/development `dist/` projection runs its 17 TypeScript hooks through
`bun`. Native installs and versioned release runtimes route those same hooks
through `aidlc`. If a source-generated install cannot find Bun on the
non-interactive PATH, its hooks will not fire.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows
npm install -g bun
# or: powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify
bun --version
```

For a source-generated `dist/` install, `bun` must be on the PATH the harness
hands its hooks. A harness started from a terminal hands them that terminal's
PATH, so `bun --version` working there is enough. A harness started from the
dock, a desktop icon, or a service does not get that PATH. If its hooks do not
run, open a terminal where `bun --version` works and run
`bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc.ts doctor` there (for example
`bun .kiro/tools/aidlc.ts doctor`): its `Runtime hook PATH` row names the
directory to add and where. Restart the harness afterwards. Until then, start
it from that terminal. On native
Windows PowerShell, the system PATH entry set by `npm install -g bun` is
sufficient.

### Kiro IDE hooks not running

Kiro IDE runs a folder's hooks only after you allow it to run commands in that
folder and then reload the window. Until you allow it, every command the agent
runs comes back with no output and exit code -1, so no AI-DLC message can show;
the agent gives you the step itself. Before your first chat message in the
project, doctor warns "AIDLC hooks have not run in this project yet"; that is
expected.

Trust only a folder whose contents you know (your own project, or one you have
checked), because trusting lets the folder's `.kiro` hooks run commands on your
machine (see [First run](harnesses/kiro-ide.md#first-run)).

1. Choose **Trust Folder & Continue** when Kiro asks whether you trust this
   folder. If the Restricted Mode banner shows at the top of the window
   instead, select **Manage** on it, then **Trust**.
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P, or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and run
   **Developer: Reload Window**. Trust takes effect after the reload.
3. Say carry on in the chat. If your next message is still not recorded,
   `/aidlc --doctor` shows why.

### Kiro CLI hooks not running

Kiro CLI's v2 and v3 engines read different hook registrations. If the
engine does not match the AI-DLC distribution you installed, no hook runs.
Every approval and confirmation then says no human reply has arrived, reviews
say the output has no recorded write, and, after the first workflow stage,
doctor reports "Hooks have never executed". Restarting on the same engine
changes nothing.

- **`kiro` distribution** (`.kiro/agents/aidlc.json`): hooks run on Kiro CLI's
  v2 engine, with the `aidlc` agent active; v3 does not run the file as AI-DLC
  ships it. With another agent picked, type `/agent` and pick `aidlc`, then
  carry on in the same chat. If Kiro prints `agent "aidlc" needs upgrading for
  this agent engine` under its replies, the session is on the 3.0 engine: quit
  Kiro and start it again in this folder with
  `kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v2 --agent aidlc`. From an ACP client, start
  `kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v2`.
- **`kiro-ide` distribution** (`.kiro/hooks/aidlc-*.json`): hooks run only on
  Kiro CLI's v3 engine. `kiro-cli chat` reads the v3 pin in
  `.kiro/settings/cli.json`; `kiro-cli acp` does not, so an ACP client must
  start `kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v3`. It must also declare
  `clientCapabilities._meta.kiro.hooks` as `{ enabled: true, v2: true }` in its
  `initialize` request. Without both values, v3 runs no hooks.

These behaviours were measured on Kiro CLI 2.21.1, and a later Kiro CLI may
change them. After you switch, send a message and run `/aidlc --doctor`. On
the `kiro` distribution, your message leaves the first heartbeat, so doctor
confirms the hooks from then on; until then it warns that they have not run in
this project yet.

### GitHub Copilot hooks not running

VS Code runs a project's hooks only in a trusted workspace with the **Chat: Use
Hooks** setting (`chat.useHooks`) on, and your organization can switch that
setting off. `aidlc config` turns it on in the folder's `.vscode/settings.json`
when the project does not set it, and a folder's value beats a user setting
that is off. The Copilot CLI runs hooks only in a folder it trusts. Neither
says anything in the chat when it skips them, so AI-DLC does: when no hook has
run for your message, the agent turns the folder setting on itself and
shows one line. Send your next message in the same chat; no new chat or reload
is needed. Before your first Copilot chat in the folder, doctor warns "AIDLC
hooks have not run in this project yet"; that is expected until a chat has
started.

1. In VS Code, VS Code asks the first time whether you trust the folder's
   authors; trust it. If your organization has switched Chat: Use Hooks off,
   only your administrator can turn it back on.
2. In the Copilot CLI, trust the folder when it asks. A headless `copilot -p`
   run also needs `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_REPO_HOOKS=1` in its environment.

See [GitHub Copilot](harnesses/copilot.md) for the folder trust details.

### Codex CLI hooks not trusted

Codex runs a project's hooks only once you trust them in its `/hooks` screen,
and it asks again when the hooks change. In Codex, type `/hooks`, press `t` to
trust all, then press Esc, and carry on in the same chat. Nothing outside Codex
can do this for you.

### opencode plugin not loaded

opencode loads AI-DLC's plugin only when it starts plainly in the project
folder: not under `--pure`, and not from a subfolder. Quit opencode and start
it again with just `opencode` in the project folder, then type `/aidlc` to
carry on.

### Claude managed policy blocks project hooks

If `/hooks` reports that hooks are restricted by policy and shows zero configured hooks, run `/aidlc --doctor`. On Claude Code, doctor reads `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux/WSL, or `%ProgramFiles%\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` followed by the legacy `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` location on Windows. Each candidate also includes alphabetical JSON fragments under its sibling `managed-settings.d/` directory. An effective top-level `allowManagedHooksOnly: true` blocks every project hook declared in `.claude/settings.json`. Set `AIDLC_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH` when the managed file lives elsewhere; its sibling fragment directory is included automatically.

Only your Claude Code administrator can lift this managed setting: ask them to allow project hooks.

### Cursor project outside a git repository

If Cursor keeps asking you to approve the same plan, or says your choice did not get recorded, run `/aidlc --doctor`. Cursor may skip project hooks in a folder that is not in a git repository, and without the hooks your approvals are never recorded. When doctor fails "project is in a git repository", run `git init` in the project, then fully restart Cursor and trust the folder when asked. `aidlc config --harness cursor` and the copy installer print the same advice when they set up a project outside a git repository.

### Reviewer tool calls refused ("This review cannot open ...")

During a per-unit Construction review, the reviewer-scope hook refuses the dispatched reviewer's tool calls that reach into sibling units' `construction/` paths (the stage-protocol-reviewer.md section 12a read-scope bound); the refusal names the current unit and directs the reviewer to the supplied files and that unit's own path, and each refusal records a `REVIEWER_SCOPE_BLOCKED` audit row. If your own source tree contains a `construction/` directory unrelated to AI-DLC units (so legitimate reviewer reads are being refused), `/aidlc config set guard.reviewer-scope off` lowers just the reviewer read-scope check for the piece of work you are on (recorded as a `GUARD_DISABLED` audit row, back on for the next one), and `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK=1` disables that read-scope enforcement machine-wide; the prose bound still governs under either. Neither setting permits a claimed team checkout to write another Unit's `construction/` subtree. A general request in chat does not lower the read-scope check: type the switch above so the human-turn hook applies it at prompt time. Changing scope alone never lowers the running policy. A reviewer being refused with NO review in flight means a stale dispatch record - check `/aidlc --doctor`'s hook-drop counters (`reviewer-scope.drops`) and delete `<record>/.aidlc-engine/reviewer-dispatch.json` if present (records older than 6 hours are ignored and cleaned automatically).

Ordinary filters such as `grep latency construction/U03-scoring/nfr.md | grep endpoint` are allowed because the second `grep` searches the piped text. A pipe does not exempt commands that still traverse files: recursive `grep`, `rg --files`, and `rg -f -` still need an in-scope search root or, for `rg`, a glob constrained to the current unit. Pattern files supplied with `-f` must also be in scope. When a pathless command falls back to `.` and is refused, the message identifies that root as implicit.

### Sensors are not firing

Check the **Sensors** row in `/aidlc --status`. The `classic` scope defaults to Sensors on. If an intent override or kill switch turns Sensors off, automatic write-time checks, gate-start checks, revision checks, and approve-time revision-backstop checks do not run. `/aidlc --sensors on` opts the active intent back in. `AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1` takes precedence over that intent setting; unset it (and any recorded project bypass) to allow automatic checks again. All hooks stay installed, and explicit `aidlc engine sensor fire` remains available for diagnostics even when automatic sensors are off.

### Statusline shows a cost segment you don't want (or usage tracking concerns)

On Claude Code, per-stage token usage and cost tracking is on by default: the fold-usage hook records transcript usage into a gitignored local ledger (`aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/usage-ledger.json`), the statusline appends `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>`, and completion audit events carry cost rollups. Nothing is transmitted anywhere (metrics emission is separately opt-in via `AIDLC_METRICS_ENDPOINT`). To turn all local tracking off, set `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1`: the ledger stops updating, the statusline segment disappears, and completion events add no rollup fields. An existing ledger is left on disk; delete it manually if you also want the history gone. Unsetting the flag resumes tracking.

**The `$<usd>` figure is a local estimate, not a bill.** It is priced from **public list prices** in the shipped rate table (see [Rate table and overrides](../reference/06-hooks-and-tools.md#rate-table-and-overrides)). When Amazon Bedrock is the recorded provider (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`), what Bedrock actually charges depends on your inference profile, region, service tier, and any negotiated or subscription pricing, so the estimate may not match your invoice. Most of the token volume in a long workflow is cache reads — billed, at the reduced cache-read rate — so the counts and the estimate grow steadily; that is real usage, not inflation. Treat the number as a personal awareness signal.

**To price the estimate at your own rates**, set `AIDLC_MODEL_RATES` to a rates file with the same shape as the shipped `.claude/tools/data/model-rates.json` (USD per million tokens, one key per model version, so `opus-5-5` and `opus-5` are separate rows). A partial file only changes the models it names; everything else keeps the shipped defaults. Rates are applied as usage is recorded, so a change prices turns from that point on; totals already in the ledger keep the rates they were recorded at.

**If you'd rather not show the estimate — while presenting, screen-sharing, or recording — turn the cost segment off.** Add the kill switch to the gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json` (it only removes the token/cost segment — the workflow is unaffected):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING": "1"
  }
}
```

### Hook not configured

Hooks are registered project-wide in the harness's native configuration. On
Claude, verify that `.claude/settings.json` contains the expected `hooks`
events and `statusLine`. For a native project, complete active workflows,
then run `aidlc config --harness claude` to restore the shipped registrations;
your own hook entries are kept. A copy-channel project instead uses
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config --harness claude --from <the runtime/claude root you copied from>`.
No `--force` is needed. Notes tell you when registrations were restored.
Doctor fails when a flow-altering registration changes its event, matcher, or
command, or when a shipped hook is no longer wired. Drift in other AI-DLC
registrations produces a warning. Your own additional hooks do not trigger
drift warnings. An absent `statusLine` is restored too, but a custom non-AI-DLC
statusline is kept. Delete that key and refresh if you want the shipped one
again.
For a manual copy,
replace the complete harness root from the same versioned
`runtime/<harness>/` archive (a copy never replaces your `.gitignore` or
`AGENTS.md`); do not patch one hook command in isolation. The manual archive is Bun-shaped and
does not require the native `aidlc` executable.

### Hooks disabled globally (`disableAllHooks`)

Claude Code honours `"disableAllHooks": true` in any settings layer: enterprise managed settings, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `settings.json` under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when that is set). When set, **every** hook is silently skipped even though the files are present and correctly wired, so the workflow cannot record your replies. `/aidlc --doctor` detects this and fails a **Hooks enabled** row naming the offending layer, following Claude Code's layer precedence so a higher-precedence `false` suppresses a lower `true`. When no hook has run for your message, the agent makes the change below itself before any work, and Claude Code asks you first.

- If the offending layer is a **project or user file**, set `"disableAllHooks": false` in this project's `.claude/settings.local.json`. That file outranks the project and user files, so it covers a switch-off in any of them without changing your user settings, and it works in the same chat: no restart and no `/hooks`.
- If it is **enterprise managed settings**, the highest-precedence layer, a project or user file cannot override it: ask your Claude Code administrator to allow project hooks.
- If you **started Claude Code with a setting that turns hooks off** (for example `--settings '{"disableAllHooks": true}'`), a project file cannot override it either, and doctor cannot see it: start Claude Code again without that setting.

The check reads the on-disk managed-settings **file** (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux, `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `%ProgramFiles%\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` on current Windows — `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` is a legacy secondary) plus alphabetical JSON files in the sibling `managed-settings.d/` directory. It does **not** inspect other managed channels Claude Code supports (MDM, Windows registry, or a remote/server-managed source), so a passing row means the resolved value is not `true` in any settings file the check could read, not a guarantee those channels are clean. If your managed file lives at a non-standard path, point the check at it with `AIDLC_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH=/path/to/managed-settings.json`; fragments beside that file are included.

## Kiro IDE Read Denials

### Kiro IDE denies every read under .kiro/ ("Rule: deny fs_read matching")

**Symptom**: Every stage, agent, and protocol read is denied, blocking the workflow:

```text
Tool call denied by user's permissions. Rule: deny fs_read matching ".kiro/" Source: ~/.config/git/ignore
```

[Kiro IDE honours](https://kiro.dev/docs/kiroignore/) git's global excludes file
(in git repositories) and `~/.kiro/settings/kiroignore` automatically. Workspace
ignore files apply only when the IDE's `kiroAgent.agentIgnoreFiles` setting names
them (the default includes `.gitignore`; `[]` disables workspace sources).
It evaluates each ignore file on its own: a project `!.kiro/` negation does not
undo a global `.kiro/` rule, even when `git check-ignore` reports the path as not
ignored. A `permissions.yaml` `fs_read` allow does **not** clear the denial:
[Kiro applies deny-overrides across scopes](https://kiro.dev/docs/permissions/).

Run `/aidlc --doctor`. For an IDE install (`.kiro/agents/aidlc.md` present), it
reports the offending source as:

```text
Kiro IDE ignore sources: <source>:<line> hides .kiro/
```

Doctor tests the reads the engine sends the agent to make through `fs_read`,
from the engine's own roster: for every stage that `harness.json` selects in the
compiled stage graph, the stage file and the persona and knowledge the conductor
holds inline (at Standard and Minimal depth, within the directive's 8 KiB
`inline_context_paths` cap), plus `stage-protocol.md` and its
`stage-protocol-<name>.md` modules and the files beside each skill's `SKILL.md`.
Plugins count however they were composed. Contributor-only protocol files such as
`stage-definition.md` are not loaded. `SKILL.md` files, the IDE conductor agent (`agents/aidlc.md`),
`aidlc-common/conductor.md`, and `tools/`, `sensors/`, `hooks/`, `scopes/`, and
`steering/` are loaded by the IDE or the engine, not through `fs_read`, and are
not counted. A rule that hides only some of them is
reported with a count and the framework folders it touches, for example
`hides 11 of 110 framework files (.kiro/agents/)`.

Global-source matches fail doctor. Project `.gitignore` and `.kiroignore` matches
warn instead, because doctor cannot read the IDE setting that governs whether
those workspace files apply.

`<source>` is a fixed name: `~/.config/git/ignore` (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore`), `core.excludesFile` (run
`git config --get core.excludesFile` for its path), `~/.kiro/settings/kiroignore`,
`.gitignore`, or `.kiroignore`. Doctor output is read by the agent, so doctor
never prints an ignore file's path, its rules, or git's error text.

A source doctor cannot evaluate warns as `not evaluated`, and its `fix:` line
names the way forward:

- **`git is not available`**: put `git` on PATH and re-run doctor. Until then,
  check the named files by hand. Git's global excludes file is the
  `core.excludesFile` git reads, most specific first: command-scope settings in
  the environment (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` with `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>` and
  `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<n>`, or `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`), the repository config
  (`.git/config` and `.git/config.worktree`; in a linked worktree or submodule,
  where `.git` is a file, the git directory its `gitdir:` line names and the
  directory that git directory's `commondir` file names), your global git config
  (`~/.gitconfig`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` or `~/.config/git/config`, or
  the file `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` names), then the system gitconfig (the file
  `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` names, else the system file of the git installation,
  such as `/etc/gitconfig` or `etc/gitconfig` under a Git for Windows install;
  skipped when `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` is true). Follow each file's
  `include.path` and applicable `includeIf.<condition>.path` entries
  recursively. When none sets it, the file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore`, or
  `~/.config/git/ignore` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.
- **`git rev-parse exit <n>`** or **`git config exit <n>`**: git refuses this
  project even though a repository exists on disk. Run `git status` in the
  project to see why; for dubious ownership, run the
  `git config --global --add safe.directory` command git prints. Meanwhile, run
  `git config --get core.excludesFile` outside the project (in your home
  directory, for example) to find git's global excludes file (no output means
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore`, or `~/.config/git/ignore` when
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset) and check it.
- **Any other reason**, such as a git command that `did not finish` (it timed
  out): check the named files by hand; git's global excludes file is the one
  `git config --get core.excludesFile` prints.

If `GIT_CONFIG` is set in your shell, clear it before running
`git config --get core.excludesFile`, for example with
`env -u GIT_CONFIG git config --get core.excludesFile` (in PowerShell, run
`Remove-Item Env:GIT_CONFIG` first). `GIT_CONFIG` points only `git config` at
another file, so the command would otherwise name a file git does not apply;
doctor clears it the same way.

Remove or narrow the rule at the named line, then re-run `/aidlc --doctor`.
Keep per-repo personal ignores in that repo's `.git/info/exclude`, which git
honours and Kiro does not list as an ignore source. A negation in another file
or a permissions allow is not a substitute for fixing the offending rule.

## State File Issues

**Symptom**: Orchestrator reports corrupted state, or workflow behaves unexpectedly.

### State file missing

The state file is created during Initialization or when a scope is provided to `/aidlc`.

- Run `/aidlc --status` to confirm no workflow is active
- Run `/aidlc` or `/aidlc <scope>` to start a fresh workflow

### State file corrupted

The `validate-state.ts` hook checks for two required sections on every compaction: `## Stage Progress` and `## Current Status`. To repair:

1. Run `/aidlc --doctor` and address any reported state, graph, or hook issues
2. If the generated Stage Progress rows are stale, re-run the engine path that owns state resync: start or resume the workflow with `/aidlc`, or change scope through `/aidlc --scope <scope>` so the compiled graph and scope grid are reapplied
3. Use `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-shared/state-template.md` only as the section and field contract; do not restore stage rows by hand from the template
4. If the record cannot be repaired, retire it with `/aidlc intent archive <name>` (its record dir under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/` is preserved) and run `/aidlc` to start fresh

---

## Dispatched Stage Timeouts

**Symptom**: A dispatched stage (Reverse Engineering, Practices Discovery, User Stories, or Code Generation) returns errors or truncated output.

### What happens

The framework follows a built-in retry protocol:

1. **Automatic retry** with a reduced-context prompt
2. **If retry fails**, two options:
   - **Run inline** — execute the stage directly in the main conversation (no subagent boundary)
   - **Skip and revisit** — mark the stage incomplete and return later

### Manual recovery

Re-run `/aidlc`: it detects the `[-]` (in-progress) state and carries on with the stage; say redo to run it again from the start. Check the `audit/` shards for the error entry to understand what failed.

---

## Approval Gate Stuck

**Symptom**: The workflow is waiting for your response at an approval gate.

### How to proceed

Type your response when prompted. Options are:

- **Approve** — continue to the next stage
- **Request Changes** — provide feedback for revision

On Kiro IDE, if you already replied and the workflow still waits, see
[Kiro IDE hooks not running](#kiro-ide-hooks-not-running). On Kiro CLI, see
[Kiro CLI hooks not running](#kiro-cli-hooks-not-running).

### Revision loop escape hatch

After 3 revision cycles on the same stage, a third option appears: **Accept as-is**. This archives the current version and moves on.

### Skipping a stage

Use `/aidlc --stage <target>` to jump to a different stage. Intervening stages will be marked `[S]` (skipped) in the state file.

### A reviewed document needs another change

If a final review already covers the document, direct edits are blocked so the
review cannot silently certify different content.

- While the stage is active or awaiting approval, describe the change and choose
  **Request Changes**. The decision can be recorded before the gate opens.
- While the stage is `[R]`, restart it with `/aidlc --stage <slug>`.
- After the stage is `[x]`, restore the reviewed source state or jump back with
  `/aidlc --stage <slug>` to redo it.

When only workspace source changed and the one recovery review is still
available, start that recovery request before replacing the old Review section.
The pending request temporarily permits writes only to that stage or Unit while
the stale condition remains. Restoring the reviewed workspace source, recording
the verdict, or starting/resuming another session re-arms the freeze. Restoring
output-document bytes does not clear audit-recorded artifact staleness. After a
session restart, retry the same pending request before replacing the Review
section. The gate remains closed until the matching verdict is recorded.

### Plan Approval asked twice for the same plan

**Symptom**: Code Generation presents the Plan Approval question again for a plan
you already approved.

Plan Approval binds to the plan, unit test instructions, and Testing Contract
content, to the target, and to the current stage attempt. It is NOT reopened by
re-running `/aidlc`, by a session restart or a context compaction, by a Stop-hook
probe, or by `/aidlc --status`. Ticking a plan checkbox does not reopen it
either, and recording a review never touches the plan.

For the same target and attempt, plan, test instruction, or Testing Contract
edits reopen approval only under Guard Policy `strict`. Under `relaxed` or
`off`, work continues with the updated content and the original approval
record stays intact; it does not claim you approved the edits. The
`Guard Policy:` line of `/aidlc --status` shows the effective setting. You can still ask to review the plan again.

If code generation starts without asking you about the plan at all, plan
approval is off for this piece of work: status shows where that came from, for
example `Plan Approval: off (from scope poc)`. The line that names each plan
asks whether you want to look at it first; you can also ask to be asked about
every plan. See [Plan approval](13-customization.md#plan-approval).

Testing Posture, scope, test strategy, or project type changes follow the same
rule within the same intent, target, and attempt. Refresh the current contract
and instructions as needed; a lowered fence permits continued execution
without asking for approval again solely because those inputs changed.

If you are asked again, check what changed and which rule applies:

- the plan content or embedded Testing Contract while the plan-approval fence
  is on (beyond a ticked task marker, or a terminal `## Review` section left by a
  review recorded before review records existed)
- the unit-test instructions content, any byte of it: the instructions are handed
  to the developer in full, so they bind byte-exactly, and a section appended to
  them after approval reopens it when the plan-approval fence is on
- the Testing Posture, scope, test strategy, or project type while the
  plan-approval fence is on
- the active intent, Unit, or stage target
- the stage attempt: a backward jump, a Request Changes, a gate rejection, or a
  workflow restart

The question names what it is about. Other code moving after approval (a `git
pull`, another Unit landing) never asks again: the build continues and you hear
one line naming the files. Nor does anything between your answer and the build:
a long chat compacting its context, parking the work and resuming it, or another
question coming up first. Say "review the plan" if you want to look again first,
including right after any of those: the plan is shown for approval again before
anything more is built.

### Plan Approval is not recorded

**Symptom**: you answered the Plan Approval question, but AI-DLC shows it again.

Your answer counts from any chat on this piece of work, in your own words ("1",
"approve", "looks good", "rename the handler"): the agent records the choice
you made, with your words beside it. The question comes back only when the
agent could not record a choice, most often because the reply arrived before
the question was shown, or in a chat where the harness did not pass it to
AI-DLC. Answer the question it shows. If it keeps coming back, run
`/aidlc --doctor`: a harness whose prompt hook does not run cannot record any
reply. A long chat that compacts its context while the question waits keeps
the question open, so your answer still counts.

If AI-DLC says the workspace source cannot be read, the plan cannot be approved
yet, because nothing could say what the build starts from. Repair the source
boundary the message names (shrink or exclude the offending path, declare real
source under an excluded directory in `.aidlc-source-paths.json`, or remove a
broken symlink), then run `/aidlc` (`$aidlc` on Codex). `/aidlc --doctor` has a
"Workspace source boundary binds" check that names the failing path.

If the plan's Testing Contract is refused, the message names one of three
causes: the block is missing, it is not valid JSON, or it changed after it was
rendered. The repair is the same for all three: re-run `render` and replace the
whole `## Testing Contract` section. A changed block usually means a shell
command rewrote the file and re-encoded its characters (for example PowerShell
`Set-Content`); artifacts are edited with the file-editing tool instead. When
your own edit broke the block, the assistant repairs it and asks you once to
build the edited plan.

**Legacy Kiro IDE windows.** A Kiro IDE build that passes no typed text to
AI-DLC approves plans with the picker only, through the older recorded
decision and answer steps. There an answer binds to the chat session it was
given in, and the break-glass exit remains: type exactly `Override Plan
Approval: <your reason>` as a chat message and the assistant re-runs the answer

## A Bolt attempt was set aside — getting the files back

A recovery can set aside an attempt when its reviewed files changed again and
its one allowed re-review was already used. The recovery abort's `--discard`
saves tracked files and non-ignored untracked files (or the remaining branch
tip when the checkout is already gone) plus reviewed source refs in local Git
before removing the old checkout and branch, so a fresh attempt can start.
An ordinary Abort without `--discard` leaves the checkout in place and returns
`parked_ref: null`, with no `parked_stamp`, `parked_mode`, `parked_repo`,
`restore_operation`, `restore_hint`, `restore_hint_error`, or `parked_excludes`.
After a discard, the assistant tells you why it set the attempt aside and offers
restoration only when `restore_operation` is present, regardless of whether a
display hint could be rendered.
Every successful abort retains `reason: "aborted"` and echoes the supplied
`--reason` text in the additive `abort_reason` field. When an attempt was parked,
the result includes the saved descriptor:
`parked_ref`, `parked_stamp`, `parked_mode` (`snapshot`, `branch-tip`, or
`evidence-only`), and `parked_repo` (`null` for the project root, otherwise the
sibling repository name).

If files were saved, ask to restore them. The assistant uses the saved result's
`restore_operation`: route `worktree`, args
`["restore", "--slug", slug, "--parked", stamp, "--repo", repo ?? ".", "--intent", recordDirName, "--space", space]` when the
stamp is known. The final selectors pin the owning intent. It invokes the installed `{{INVOKE}} engine worktree <args...>`
route with each listed arg exactly as a separate argv argument, never joined
into a shell command. `restore_hint` is human display text only, not the
assistant's execution input. The equivalent manual command, run from the main
project checkout, is:

```bash
aidlc engine worktree restore --slug <slug> --parked <stamp> --repo <name|.> --intent <record-dir-name> --space <space>
```

The operation always includes `--repo <name>` for a sibling repository or
`--repo .` for the root. Its optional display hint is safely rendered for the
selected shell; a native install uses the prefix above, while a Bun-based copy
install uses `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-worktree.ts`, substituting your harness
directory. If safe rendering fails, for example because the harness directory
is invalid, the result omits `restore_hint` and supplies `restore_hint_error`
with the reason. The typed operation remains available; this does not mean
that only evidence was saved or withdraw the restoration offer.

Do not drop the operation's exact stamp, repository, or owning intent selectors: without
`--parked`, restore chooses the latest saved head. For manual invocation an exact
stamp found in only one repository selects it before generic slug ambiguity;
if selection is still ambiguous, use doctor's exact operation with `--repo <name>`
or `--repo .` for the project root.

If a saved namespace is known but its discard descriptor is unavailable, the
fallback retains `parked_ref` and derives `parked_stamp` from its namespace
only when the stamp parses strictly; otherwise `parked_stamp` is `null`.
It reports `parked_mode: null` and `parked_repo: null` and omits
`restore_operation`, `restore_hint`, `restore_hint_error`, and `parked_excludes`,
rather than guessing a repository, saved mode, or latest-attempt selection.
Instead, `recovery_hint` asks you to run doctor to list set-aside attempts and
their exact restore commands. The hint is plain guidance, not an executable
operation. The assistant must not claim what files were saved or offer restoration
from the fallback alone. If no namespace was saved, `parked_ref` is `null`;
`parked_stamp`, `parked_mode`, `parked_repo`, `restore_operation`, `restore_hint`,
`restore_hint_error`, `parked_excludes`, and `recovery_hint` are absent.

If only review evidence remained, discard reports `parked_mode: "evidence-only"`
and `parked_commit: "-"`. Abort keeps the ref, stamp, mode, and repository but
omits `restore_operation`, `restore_hint`, `restore_hint_error`, and
`parked_excludes`. The assistant says: "Nothing of its
working files remained to save; only its review evidence was kept." It does
not offer restoration. Selecting that attempt with restore, even with `--raw`,
refuses with `no restorable files were parked for <slug> <stamp>; only review evidence was kept`.

After a successful restore, open the returned `worktree_path`, normally
`.aidlc/restored/bolt-<id8>_<slug>-<stamp>` (the recorded legacy name for a pre-upgrade attempt). It is separate from any new live attempt;
restoring files does not resume the old attempt or make its review current.
This is local recovery, not a remote backup. If the old checkout was already
gone, only its remaining branch tip and review evidence could be saved; if its
branch was gone too, only review evidence could remain.

**Limits depend on `parked_mode`:** a snapshot reports
`parked_excludes: ["ignored files", "eol/text=auto normalization"]`. Ignored
untracked files are not saved (tracked files remain included), and normalization
may change line endings while saving; normalized bytes cannot be recovered,
even with `--raw`. A branch tip instead reports
`["uncommitted files (no working tree existed)"]`, and the assistant says:
"I kept its committed work; there were no uncommitted files to save."
Snapshots restore stored blobs directly; branch tips use ordinary checkout
conversions unless `--raw` is given.
See the [restore command reference](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-engine-worktree-restore-recover-files-from-a-set-aside-attempt)
for filter failures and raw recovery details.

Run `/aidlc --doctor` (or `aidlc doctor`) to find saved attempts. Its informational
**Parked attempts** section lists slug, stamp, age, mode, restored-checkout
presence, and typed recovery operations with exact `--parked <stamp>` and
explicit `--repo <name>` or `--repo .` args, followed by owning `--intent` and `--space` selectors. Every JSON entry has
`purge_operation`; only restorable entries have `restore_operation`. Each has
route `worktree` and args to pass exactly as argv, never a shell command string.
Optional `restore_command` and `purge_command` are safe human display text;
if rendering fails, the corresponding command is omitted and
`restore_command_error` or `purge_command_error` explains why, without removing
the operation. Evidence-only entries have only the purge operation and its
command-or-error fields. Impossible dates or times have `age_days: null` in JSON
and show `unknown` in human-readable output. Saved attempts are not warnings or
failures.

Doctor resolves namespaced attempts through their intent's registry UUID and
legacy attempts through the exact `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` `Parked ref` provenance.
Unknown or ambiguous owners and unattributed legacy parks are not listed.
Once you no longer need one, remove any restored checkout first, then:

```bash
aidlc engine worktree purge --slug <slug> --parked <stamp> --repo <name|.> --intent <record-dir-name> --space <space>
aidlc engine worktree purge --slug <slug> --older-than 30 --repo <name|.> --intent <record-dir-name> --space <space>
```

Purge without either stamp selector removes every saved stamp for the selected intent's Bolt.
`--older-than` accepts nonnegative finite days and selects strictly older UTC
stamp timestamps, ignoring any `-N` suffix. The strict calendar parser rejects
impossible dates and times rather than normalizing them. Age-filtered purge
keeps unparseable stamps and reports them in `skipped_unparseable`. This JSON
array is always present and otherwise empty; exact-stamp or all-stamp purge
can remove unparseable stamps. `--older-than` cannot be combined with
`--parked`. Purge refuses while a selected restored checkout exists, even if
moved; it never removes a live Bolt checkout. Use the same Bun tool prefix for
copy installs. See the [purge reference](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-engine-worktree-purge-remove-recovery-refs).

Restore and purge reject unknown or duplicate flags before selecting or changing
anything; use only the flags in the command reference. Recovery selectors and
doctor accept the project root (`.`) and valid Git repositories named in the
same slug's `WORKTREE_CREATED` or `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` audit `Repo` fields even
when those sibling names are symlinks: the framework may recover exactly where
it recorded the attempt's worktree or parking. This admission is slug-scoped;
records for other slugs never widen this slug's repository set. Membership in
a current or historical intent's repo list alone cannot admit a symlink.
Intent-list candidates and unrecorded discovered siblings must be real
immediate child directories whose canonical paths stay directly under the
canonical workspace root (`isWorkspaceRepoDir`). Arbitrary paths and symlink
aliases without same-slug audit provenance are refused. These recovery selectors
do not change live create/discard commands or the required human consent.

## Context Compaction

**Symptom**: Claude Code summarized earlier conversation context. The session may feel like it "forgot" recent discussion.

### What is preserved

All record-dir artifacts, `aidlc-state.md`, the `audit/` shards, and `.aidlc-engine/recovery.md` persist on disk. Only in-memory conversation context and partial in-progress work not yet written to files is lost.

### How to recover

Run `/aidlc` after compaction. The framework:

1. Reads `aidlc-state.md` to load workflow position
2. Compares `.aidlc-engine/recovery.md` against the state file - warns if they differ
3. Carries on where the work stopped

If the recovery breadcrumb warns about a mismatch, say "redo this stage" to safely re-execute the stage that was in progress during compaction.

### The build stops after a compaction

**Symptom** (GitHub Copilot): you approved the code plan, the build started, and after the chat compacted every build step the assistant tries is refused.

Your approval, the workflow state, and every file already written are kept; only what the assistant had not yet written to a file is gone from the chat. After a compaction the assistant must read its step again before it builds anything. It runs `next` as its own command, which hands the approved build straight back without asking you again. `/aidlc --doctor` shows the step as out of date, with the time and the reason (the chat was compacted, or the workflow state changed after the step was issued, naming what changed when it is known), until that `next` runs.

---

## Audit Log Growing Too Large

**Symptom**: this clone's audit shard has grown to thousands of lines over a long project.

A long project's shard is large by design; leave it where it is. The engine reads every shard in `audit/` to know which stages you approved and which Units you finished, so moving one out of `audit/` makes that work count as not done and the engine hands it out again. (The PreToolUse guard refuses the agent's file and shell tools any write into `audit/`.)

### Git considerations

The `audit/` shards are committed (not gitignored), see [What to Commit vs. Gitignore](14-artifacts-reference.md#what-to-commit-vs-gitignore). Each clone writes its own `<host>-<clone>.md` shard, so concurrent appends never merge-conflict.

### Moved, copied, or synced projects

`aidlc/.aidlc-clone-id` records this clone's token and the host name it was first used on, so the shard name stays the same when the machine's name changes or the folder is copied or synced to another laptop: the work continues in one shard. A fresh `git clone` gets its own token and shard. Two copies of one folder are one clone, so if two people (or two laptops) work at the same time, give each its own `git clone`. If a sync tool leaves a conflict copy such as `<host>-<clone> 2.md`, AI-DLC reads the rows it shares with the original once, so finished work keeps counting and the copy can stay. With team Unit ownership, landing a Unit still stops on any file it did not expect, a copy included: it names the file (`Unit landing requires a clean source worktree; commit or stash: ...`).

If such a copy was already in your project on an earlier release and you kept working, Units you finished while the copy sat there may be handed out once more after you upgrade (the Units you finished before the copy count again). Nothing is deleted: the Unit's files are still there, so for most stages finishing it again only records it; a Code Generation Unit may ask you to approve its plan once more and build again from the code already in your branch. It happens once and never repeats, and a planned follow-up removes even that.

One narrow case: a Code Generation Unit built in its own worktree that had finished but was not yet merged when you upgraded. Building it again stops with `Worktree directory already exists`, or `resume requires the completed, merged prior Bolt`. Run `aidlc engine worktree discard --slug <unit>`: it sets the earlier attempt's files aside before it removes that worktree, then the next `/aidlc` builds the Unit again, and `aidlc engine worktree restore --slug <unit>` brings the earlier files back into a separate checkout whenever you want them.

---

## Lock Files Left Behind

**Symptom**: Hooks appear to hang briefly then skip. Subsequent audit entries are not written.

The audit hooks use `mkdir`-based locking (via `lib.ts`) to prevent concurrent writes. If a hook is interrupted, the lock directory may persist. Lock files are created in the system temp directory (`os.tmpdir()` -- typically `/tmp/` on macOS/Linux, `%TEMP%` on Windows).

### Finding stale locks

```bash
# macOS / Linux
ls -la /tmp/.aidlc-*

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem $env:TEMP -Filter ".aidlc-*"
```

Lock directories are named `.aidlc-audit-<hash>.lock` and `.aidlc-subagent-<hash>.lock` inside the system temp directory.

### Clearing stale locks

Run `/aidlc --doctor` first. It automatically clears only a provably-dead
generation, a reused PID whose creation generation no longer matches, or an old
lock whose owner stamp is genuinely missing. Matching/unknown live generations,
malformed stamps, and unreadable stamps are reported but not removed.

Before any manual cleanup, stop all AI-DLC processes using the affected locks,
confirm ownership and that the projects are quiescent, and preserve diagnostic
evidence. Investigate only the named lock; do not bulk-delete lock directories.
Locks and their owner-stamped `.reap` recovery gates are transient and recreated
as needed. `.gate-mutex` files are persistent advisory-lock anchors and may
remain empty in the temp directory; an empty file is not evidence of a stale
owner. Project transaction locks use the [ownership checks above](#transaction-lock-ownership).

---

## Statusline Issues

### Shows "ready" when workflow is active

The statusline reads the `**Lifecycle Phase**` field from `aidlc-state.md`. If that field is missing or empty, it falls back to `[AIDLC] ready`.

**Fix:** Run `/aidlc --doctor` to check state file integrity. Verify the `## Current Status` section contains a `**Lifecycle Phase**` entry.

### Shows stale data

Expected behavior — the statusline updates when the state file is next written, typically at stage transitions.

### Not appearing at all

1. Run `aidlc doctor` and repair the reported native command or host wiring.
2. On a copy install, verify Bun is on the host process PATH.
3. On Claude, verify the `.claude/settings.json` `statusLine` entry exists.
4. With no state file, `[AIDLC] ready` is the expected output.

---

## Using `--doctor`

The `--doctor` utility command validates your setup. Run it whenever something seems wrong:

```
/aidlc --doctor
```

It checks: prerequisite (`bun`), hook availability (every framework hook wired by `settings.json` must exist in `.claude/hooks/`, and a wired-but-missing hook fails loudly; a valid custom non-AI-DLC `statusLine` intentionally exempts the unwired `aidlc-statusline.ts`), hooks-not-globally-disabled (a resolved `disableAllHooks: true` in any Claude Code settings layer fails loudly), managed project-hook policy (`allowManagedHooksOnly: true`), project structure (`settings.json`), workspace shell readiness (`.claude/` + `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`), state/audit consistency (the workflow Status against a recorded `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`, and each Stage Progress checkbox against the stage starts and completions the audit recorded for the current attempt. A stage the audit shows as started whose checkbox still reads `[ ]` is what makes the workflow refuse to finish it, and the warning names the exact line to change. Under team Unit Ownership the per-unit Construction checkboxes are derived from Unit Progress, so they are not compared), hook heartbeats, graph integrity (no cycles, every graph entry has a file), the **Composed plugin surface** (enabled plugin stages are compiled; contribution sidecars and targets are valid; recorded structural additions and prose fragments remain present and unchanged), selection-aware plugin-authored checks, scope validation across all 11 scopes, **Composed scope durability** (every composer-authored scope resolves to a real plan: a scope file with no grid column, a durable `aidlc/scopes/<name>.md` record not yet projected, or a runnable workflow naming an unresolvable scope all fail, with `graph compile` as the remedy wherever compile can reach the cause; a missing column with no record behind it is reported apart, since compile emits a column only for a scope some stage declares), stage schema + graph references, and keyword overlap across scopes. Passing advisory rows include **Duplicate producers** for consumed artifacts whose producer is ambiguous by graph load order, **Rule drift** (with lifecycle-stale overlaps reported separately as stale-suppressed), **Paired sensor coverage**, stage/gate ledgers with no `HUMAN_TURN`, approval gates waiting for a human for more than 24 hours, plugin advisory checks, uncommitted workspace records, fresh in-flight compose/background-subagent state, and, when `repos.json` exists, declared-repo and managed-`.gitignore` drift. A compose marker older than 24 hours or background-subagent entry older than 2 hours fails with the exact `rm aidlc/.aidlc-*` remediation; doctor never deletes either surface. **Hook drops** is conditional: a hook that silently degraded (e.g. a plugin compose that could not apply a contribution, or a failed recompile) records a severity-tagged line to `<hooks-health>/<hook>.drops`; a `[degraded]` drop **fails** doctor (so a CI gate catches a half-applied plugin), while any other drop is a passing row naming each hook's most frequent reasons (each up to its first colon; the detail stays in the file), raised to a `Hook failures, the latest within the last day` warning while the hook's latest failure is under 24 hours old (it clears a day later or when you delete the file; an `[advisory]` line never raises it). A hook's normal decisions, such as the Stop hook letting a turn end because you have to answer first, go to `<hook>.trace` and are never counted. The plugin compose hook rewrites its drops file each run, so fixing the cause and re-composing self-clears it. Clean and warnings-only reports exit 0; any failed check exits 1. Healthy rows collapse by section unless `--verbose` is present, while every warning and failure remains visible. The report writes to stdout either way. Core checks are **read-only**: on a fresh shell with no intent yet they create nothing, so the command is safe to run before the first intent is created. Plugin checks execute installed plugin code that is required by convention to be read-only, but the runtime cannot enforce that property. Once an intent exists doctor records a `HEALTH_CHECKED` (and `GUARDRAIL_LOADED`) audit row.

On Kiro IDE, it also checks each ignore source independently for rules hiding `.kiro/`, naming the file and line. Global-source matches fail; workspace-source matches warn because `kiroAgent.agentIgnoreFiles` governs whether they apply. See [Kiro IDE Read Denials](#kiro-ide-read-denials). On every harness but Cursor it also warns "AIDLC hooks have not run in this project yet" when no AI-DLC hook has run in the project. That is expected before your first chat message; after one, its fix names your tool's step (see, for example, [Kiro IDE hooks not running](#kiro-ide-hooks-not-running) or [GitHub Copilot hooks not running](#github-copilot-hooks-not-running)). On Kiro CLI, a workflow whose hooks never ran fails "Hooks have never executed" with the engine its hooks need; see [Kiro CLI hooks not running](#kiro-cli-hooks-not-running).

The **Workspace record visibility** advisory, beside the uncommitted-records
row, catches user ignore rules added after config. It names the rule's file,
line, and hidden committed record paths; narrow the rule rather than
force-adding individual records. This warning does not change doctor's exit
code. The row is absent when the records are visible, outside a Git repository,
or when Git is unavailable.

On Claude Code, doctor also reads the machine-managed `managed-settings.json` and alphabetical `managed-settings.d/` fragments. If the effective `allowManagedHooksOnly` value is `true`, organization policy blocks every hook declared by the project's `.claude/settings.json`; only your Claude Code administrator can lift that policy. When that policy is not set and heartbeats are still absent after workflow progress, set `"disableAllHooks": false` in this project's `.claude/settings.local.json`; it works in the same chat.
When a workflow has issues, `--doctor` also prints a **Workflow diagnosis** section listing structured findings (unresolved gates, a stale or missing runtime graph, cold hooks, and similar "it will not advance" causes) — the same analysis `--doctor --export` writes to its report.

See [CLI Commands](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-doctor-health-check) for full details on what each check validates and how to fix failures.

## Sharing a Diagnostic Report

When a workflow is stuck or misbehaving — a gate that will not open, a stage that
will not advance, an approved report repeatedly refused — and you want a
maintainer to look, run:

```
/aidlc --doctor --export
```

This runs a fresh `--doctor` pass, then writes a small, **redacted** diagnostic
report to `aidlc/diagnostics/` (override with `--output <dir>`). It packages
a timestamped `.tar.gz` when a system `tar` is available; otherwise it keeps the
report directory and tells you to compress it yourself. Share that archive (or
directory) — it carries the diagnosis and redacted evidence, **not your work
product**. No workspace source, raw state/audit/runtime-graph files, or
artifact/contribution/question/memory bodies are included; paths are normalized,
intent ids are hashed, and secret-like values are scrubbed.

The report reconstructs the workflow timeline from the audit trail and runs
deterministic condition→remedy rules. The two most common causes it catches:

- **Unresolved approval gates** — a stage whose gate never resolved is the single
  most common "it will not advance" cause.
- **Stale or missing runtime graph / cold hooks** — a runtime graph older than its
  authored inputs (or absent), or a hook that has not fired in a long time,
  points at a recompile that did not run.

`report.md` inside the report lists every finding with a remedy; a remedy that
names a recovery bypass (such as an `AIDLC_DISABLE_*` env var) is flagged
as not safe to automate. See [CLI Commands](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-doctor-export-write-a-diagnostic-report)
for the full report contents and safety model.
