# Customization

AI-DLC is designed to adapt to your team's needs. This chapter covers settings overrides, scope configuration, stage customization, statusline, and tool permissions.

> **Harness-specific config.** The harness-neutral customizations — scope
> configuration, stage depth, knowledge, and rules — apply on every harness. The
> mechanism-level config in this chapter (`settings.json` / `settings.local.json`,
> the statusline command, `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, tool-permission blocks) is
> **Claude Code-specific**. Kiro CLI configures the equivalents in
> `.kiro/settings/cli.json` + its agent config; Kiro IDE uses agent Markdown
> `tools:` and `permissions.rules`. Codex uses `.codex/config.toml`
> + Starlark rules, Cursor in `.cursor/hooks.json` + `.cursor/cli.json`
> (permissions only), opencode in the project-root `opencode.json`, and Copilot
> in `.github/hooks/aidlc.json` (hook wiring) + `~/.copilot/config.json`

## Settings Overrides (`settings.local.json`)

The shared `.claude/settings.json` belongs to the project and is committed to version control. AI-DLC refreshes its own hook registrations and command allow entries while keeping your hooks, deny rules, custom `statusLine`, environment, and other settings. Notes explain what was restored or kept; `--force` is not needed for this file. Retired shipped allow entries are not removed automatically. To override settings for your local environment without affecting the team, create a personal overrides file:

```bash
cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
```

This file is listed in `.gitignore` so your personal changes are never committed. Use it to:

- Override model selection (e.g., switch to a different Opus or Sonnet model ID)
- Set environment variables for your local setup
- Adjust tool permissions for your security requirements

---

## Agent Models and Effort (Tiers)

Shipped agents are authored with a `tier:` (`judgment` | `balanced` | `templated`) that the build projects into each harness's native model/effort keys. With no recorded model policy, judgment and templated agents inherit the session model and effort. Balanced reviewers use Sonnet at medium effort on Claude Code, while Codex and opencode inherit the session model and apply their medium reasoning setting. On Kiro, Cursor, and Copilot all tiers inherit the session model and effort. See [Agent System](../reference/05-agent-system.md) for the full projection table.

The first-run wizard defaults to the `balanced` **preset**, which is distinct
from the reviewer **tier**: it records medium effort for all three groups. On
Kiro IDE, Cursor, and Copilot it records no preset, because agents there keep
your session's model and effort.
Select a preset with `aidlc config models --preset balanced --project --yes`:

| Preset | Deciding | Reviewing | Writing up |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `thorough` | session effort | `xhigh` | session effort |
| `balanced` | `medium` | `medium` | `medium` |
| `minimal` | `medium` | `medium` | `low` |

Presets set effort only, never model IDs. Per-agent exceptions override group
dials, which override shipped tier defaults. Kiro IDE, Cursor, and Copilot
cannot express these group effort dials; a policy you record there anyway is
kept and reported as unexpressed rather than written as inert keys. Kiro CLI runs each session
on one model, so there a preset sets ONE effort for the whole session
(`minimal` low, `balanced` medium, `thorough` extra-high), saved with the
session model in your personal Kiro settings; see
[Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort).
Explicit group dials still have no Kiro CLI surface. See
[Model Policy](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#model-policy) for profiles, overrides,
and the upgrade path.

To change ONE agent's effort, run `aidlc config models --agent <name> --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> --project --yes`. To pin its model, use `--model <id>` (a model ID enabled on your install) in place of `--effort`, or pass both. `--local` instead of `--project` keeps the change to yourself. Config records the change in the settings file and rewrites that agent's file from it. Do not edit the `aidlc-*-agent` files by hand where config writes them: `aidlc config models --check` reports a hand edit as drift, and the next `aidlc config` puts the recorded value back. Claude Code, Codex, and opencode take both a model and an effort for one agent (Codex runs `max` as `xhigh`, and opencode runs `xhigh` as `high`). Kiro CLI takes a model, and an effort only together with a model. On Kiro IDE, Cursor, and Copilot every agent keeps the session's model and effort, and the command says what it could not apply there; on Kiro IDE a `model:` line you add by hand to an agent's `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` changes that agent until the next `aidlc config`. To cap EVERY agent when building your own distribution from source, set a `tier_cap:` in `core/memory/org.md`/`project.md` frontmatter or run the packager with `AIDLC_TIER_CAP=<tier>`. Both are pack-time knobs on `bun scripts/package.ts`, not runtime settings.

---

## Per-Project Default Scope

When every workflow in a project should start at the same scope, set `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` in the `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` (the shipped file already has this set to `classic`, matching the framework's hard-coded fallback — set it to `feature` to run the full lifecycle by default):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE": "feature"
  }
}
```

The shipped `env` block contains only the AI-DLC scope default. Provider and
model settings remain owned by Claude Code and the user.

With this set, implicit scope resolution uses `feature`. Alternatively, record a project default with `aidlc config flags --default-scope feature --project --yes` (or `--local` for this checkout). The real `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` environment variable wins over the recorded flag; the shipped settings env entry therefore remains authoritative until you change or remove that entry. Once the intent's `aidlc-state.md` exists (under its record dir), its scope is authoritative and changes to the implicit default do not alter an in-flight workflow.

**Precedence (highest to lowest):**

1. Explicit CLI flag: `/aidlc feature` or `/aidlc --scope bugfix` wins.
2. Keyword detection in freeform text: `/aidlc fix the login bug` still maps to `bugfix`, and so does `/aidlc-init "fix the login bug"`. Users can override the detected scope at the existing confirmation prompt.
3. The real `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` environment variable, including the value supplied by `.claude/settings.json`.
4. The recorded `aidlc config flags --default-scope` value (local settings override shared project settings).
5. `classic` - the framework fallback used by unmatched-freeform resolution
   and direct `intent-create` calls without `--scope`. `/aidlc-init` with a
   description and no `--scope` shows the same plan offer as `/aidlc` instead.

**Valid values:** `enterprise`, `feature`, `mvp`, `poc`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `infra`, `security-patch`, `classic`, `workshop`, `express`. An invalid value errors at invocation time with a clear message. Teams can define additional scopes by dropping a `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file and tagging the member stages' `scopes:` lists — see [Contributing: Adding a Scope](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope). Teams can also define additional agents in `.claude/agents/` — see [Contributing: Adding an Agent](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-an-agent).

**Verifying the config:** run `/aidlc --doctor` to confirm the configured default scope is valid (environment and recorded defaults share this check):

```
✓  AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE=classic (valid)
```

**Init notice:** when the env default is applied, the orchestrator prints a one-line notice at workflow start (`Using scope=<value> from AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (.claude/settings.json)`) so the scope source is visible at the moment it takes effect.

Why only scope and not depth or test-strategy? Each scope declares a depth, and test strategy inherits that depth unless the scope overrides it. `classic` therefore starts at Standard/Standard, `workshop` at Standard/Minimal, and `express` at Minimal/Minimal. If you need to override either, pass `--depth` or `--test-strategy` on the CLI.

**Sensitive values:** `.claude/settings.json` is committed to version control. Don't put secrets, credentials, or personal overrides here — use `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) for anything sensitive.

---

## Scope Configuration

Scopes control which stages execute and at what depth and test strategy. AI-DLC provides 11 named scopes; the full table (EXECUTE/total stage counts, default depth, test strategy, and use case for each) is the single source in [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy § The 11 Core Scopes](05-scopes-and-depth.md#the-11-core-scopes). This section covers *configuring* and overriding them.

### Choosing a scope

Specify explicitly or let the orchestrator auto-detect:

```
/aidlc enterprise       # Explicit scope
/aidlc Build a payments API  # No keyword: offers composition; resolver fallback is "classic"
/aidlc Fix the login bug     # Auto-detects "bugfix"
```

### Overriding at runtime

You can override scope at any time during a workflow:

- **At any approval gate**: request a different scope or depth
- **Via utility command**: `/aidlc --scope enterprise` changes the active scope
- **Stage inclusion**: at approval gates in Ideation and Inception, you can add a previously skipped stage back into the workflow

---

## Intent Configuration

The nine intent settings are `depth`, `test-strategy`, `review`,
`guard-policy`, `sensors`, `learnings`, `summary-confirmation`,
`plan-approval`, and `collaborators`, in that order. Three more keys, `guard.review-freeze`,
`guard.state-transition`, and `guard.reviewer-scope`, switch one guard off or
back on for a single piece of work, and `guard.plan-approval` is another name
for `plan-approval`. The CLI routes share one atomic setter,
`config-change`; when a typed command lowers a guard, the human-turn hook
validates and applies its companion intent settings in the same transaction.
Mix the settings in one command rather than chaining separate updates:

```
/aidlc --depth standard --test-strategy minimal --review advisory --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off --learnings on --summary-confirmation off
/aidlc config set guard-policy strict --sensors on --learnings on
/aidlc --scope bugfix --review none --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off
```

The native equivalent is `aidlc engine config set <key> <value>` followed by
the remaining `--key value` flags. `config get <key>` accepts all thirteen keys,
and `config list` (optionally `--json`) returns all thirteen, including effective
values and sources for Guard Policy, the switchable fences, and the ceremonies
(`guard.plan-approval` is another name for `plan-approval` and reads the same):

```
/aidlc config get guard-policy
/aidlc config get plan-approval
/aidlc config get summary-confirmation
/aidlc config list --json
```

Typed `config set`, `get`, and `list` requests execute during dispatch and
return the command's actual output before the turn finishes. A refused setting
returns its error; successful settings do not advance the workflow. Guard
lowering still belongs to the human-turn hook.

The additional read-only `guard.human-presence` lookup reports `on (default)` or `off (env AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD)`; it is not a per-work setting and is not included in `config list`.

`config-change` accepts only those setting flags and `--intent`, `--space`,
`--project-dir` selectors, with at least one setting required. For example:

```bash
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts config-change --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off --intent login-fix --space platform --project-dir /work/shop
```

The typed forms `/aidlc config set guard-policy relaxed --intent <name> --space <name>`
and `/aidlc --guard-policy relaxed --intent <name> --space <name> ...` make the
human-turn hook apply the switch at prompt time to that intent and space.
The trailing `...` in the flags form stands for an optional task description.
A nonexistent named intent is refused. Without a state file, Guard Policy
`relaxed` or `off` and plan approval `off` are kept for the piece of work this
chat starts next, and any other fence switch says to create the piece of work
and type it again.

Selectors target the same intent for state, memory policy, and audit without
switching the active cursors. All supplied values are validated before mutation;
invalid values or unknown flags refuse the whole update, naming the offending
flag. A memory-enforced strict policy refuses an explicit `relaxed` or `off`
Guard Policy setting together with every companion setting and scope change.
Explicit strict and unrelated settings remain allowed. One lock covers the state read, shared
applier, complete audit batch, and single state write; an audit failure leaves
state untouched. `Last Updated` changes only for a real stored change, including
a provenance change. Repeating the same stored choice is a no-op.

Scope changes accept the same flags and use the same applier. A
same-as-current scope still applies supplied settings. Scope-owned Guard Policy
follows a stricter new default; a lower new default follows only when you asked
for the scope change, and otherwise the current value stays and the output says
so in one line. Ceremony rows still track the new scope defaults. Explicit
overrides (`set by you` or `set by a command`) and absent legacy rows are
preserved. Memory continues to control the effective policy. Explicit flags
record explicit provenance and obey
the same lowering requirement as `config-change`. A review level equal to the
new scope's own level clears the `Review Override` field to an empty string, so
stage declarations and that scope's review cap apply; any other level replaces
the cap for this piece of work.

### Ceremony Switches

Scopes own five independent ceremony defaults. Each accepts `on` or `off`.
Every shipped scope now declares all five explicitly rather than relying on a
default; a scope file that omits one still falls back to `on`. Classic sets
sensors, learnings, and plan approval to `on` and summary confirmation to `off`.
Bugfix sets learnings and summary confirmation to `off` and keeps sensors and
plan approval `on`. Express turns the first four off; poc also turns plan
approval off. `collaborators` is the exception to the on-default: it ships on
only on `enterprise` and off on every other scope, so a first run is lean and a
team re-enables collaborators deliberately.

| Scope key | Per-intent flag | Global kill switch | What off removes |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| `sensors` | `/aidlc --sensors on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1` | Sensor runs and their gate checks |
| `learnings` | `/aidlc --learnings on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS=1` | Stage learnings read/write ritual |
| `summary_confirmation` | `/aidlc --summary-confirmation on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION=1` | The separate pre-output summary-confirmation checkpoint |
| `plan_approval` | `/aidlc --plan-approval on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1` | The stop that asks you to approve each code plan before it is built ([Plan approval](#plan-approval)) |
| `collaborators` | `/aidlc --collaborators on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_COLLABORATORS=1` | A stage's support agents: off runs every stage lead-only (no blind spokes, mob round, or pipeline support link); the reviewer is unaffected |

Precedence is global kill switch (`1`) → valid intent field → scope default →
`on`. Kill switches can also be recorded with `aidlc config flags --bypass <NAME>`.
New intents store `Sensors`, `Learnings`, `Summary Confirmation`,
`Plan Approval`, and `Collaborators` after `Guard Policy` in `aidlc-state.md`, each with a source
label such as `on (from scope classic)`. For a plan composed for this piece of work, `--status` shows that label as `(from the approved plan)`; the state file keeps the scope. The label reads `set by you` when the
human-turn hook applies the message you typed itself (summary confirmation or
plan approval off typed with no description, plan approval off in your own
words, or a Guard Policy or fence switch, together with the settings typed
beside it), or when the agent turns off a check you asked it to turn off in the
chat. Sensors, learnings or summary confirmation you type with a request
(`/aidlc --learnings on build the export`), or before any work exists, also
read `set by you` on the work that request creates. Any other change, including
a flag the agent adds to the command that starts new work, is made by a command
the agent or a script runs and reads `set by a command`. A change to work already under way records `CEREMONY_SET`
either way; a flag on the command that starts new work is stored in the new
state file without one. Turning summary
confirmation or plan approval off for work already under way needs your own
turn: run by the agent, it is refused with a message asking you to type it. On a Kiro IDE build that gives hooks no message text, typing it cannot work, so the refusal asks you to update Kiro IDE ([Kiro IDE guide](harnesses/kiro-ide.md#whats-different-on-kiro)). `/aidlc --status` shows the effective value and source.
Changing scope updates scope-sourced settings while keeping your overrides;
an absent or malformed field falls back to the scope instead of blocking the run.

The composer proposes these four, plus the scope's `review_cap`, at the compose
gate, and you can change any of them before approving. Plan approval is the
one the composer never turns off itself: say "skip plan approval for this work"
at the gate and the work is created with it off, set by you. The values apply to this piece of work only, stock
plan or custom; a plan you save as a scope stores them in its frontmatter, so
every new intent on it starts with them. A kill switch still
wins: the gate marks an `on` value it forces off, and mid-workflow the agent
says in one line that the switch has to be removed outside it, without looking
for where it is set.

Apart from plan approval, which is the approval it names, these switches do
not remove approval gates, human-turn authority, audit, or team cross-unit
write protection. Classic turns off
walking-skeleton ceremony and caps gated-flow reviews at advisory; explicit autonomy retains
the single pre-merge review.

An isolated `--single` attempt uses its selected scope's policy rather than
the main intent's ceremony overrides. That scope is recorded on the synthetic
stage-start event and remains fixed through completion; resume with a different
scope is refused. Legacy isolated starts without a recorded scope retain
summary confirmation and do not enforce this scope comparison.

### Plan approval

Before code generation builds from a code plan, AI-DLC asks you to approve that
plan. The `plan_approval` ceremony decides whether it asks on this piece of work.

- **On** (every shipped scope except express and poc): each plan is shown with
  its summary and path, with **Approve Plan**, **Request Changes**, and **I'll
  edit the files**, and nothing is built until you answer.
- **Off** (express and poc): once the plan is written you see one line, and the
  build starts:

  > Plan written: aidlc/spaces/default/intents/260820-checkout/construction/code-generation/code-generation-plan.md. Plan approval (you approve each code plan before it is built) is off for this piece of work (from scope poc). Starting code generation now. Do you want to look at the plan and approve it first?

  The audit trail gets a `PLAN_APPROVAL_SKIPPED` row carrying the fingerprint of
  the plan that was built, and the questions file reads
  `[Answer]: Plan approval off`. Nothing records that you approved it.

**Review the plan first.** With plan approval off, the line that names each
plan asks whether you want to look at it first; say yes, or ask to review the
plan in your own words at any time, and that plan is shown for
approval while the build waits. The setting stays off: the next plan builds
without asking. If the plan is already being built when you ask, that build
finishes, then its plan is shown beside what was built, and nothing else starts
until you answer. Approving keeps what was built; changes you ask for come back
at that Unit's approval gate, where **Request Changes** sends it back with your
words.

**Only you turn it off.** Say so in your own words ("skip plan approval for
this work") and the agent turns it off, or type `/aidlc --plan-approval off` or
`/aidlc config set plan-approval off` and the human-turn hook applies it. Either
way it applies to this piece of work and records a `CEREMONY_SET` row; a plan already waiting for
your answer then builds. A question or remark that mentions plan approval
changes nothing. Before the work exists, at the compose gate or the scope
confirmation, your words answer that request: the piece of work created from it
starts with plan approval off, set by you (the creation line says
`no plan approval`). Said before you describe the work, they answer the next
request you make. Work created from any other request keeps its scope's value,
and typing `/aidlc --plan-approval on` first takes the words back. The agent never turns it off on its own and never
suggests it: run with no reply from you since the last decision, its setter is refused. Turning it
on (`/aidlc --plan-approval on`) works from anywhere, the agent included, and
applies from the next plan. `guard.plan-approval` is another name for the same
switch: `/aidlc config set guard.plan-approval off` turns plan approval off and
writes no `Guards Off` line.

**Edited plans.** Whether a plan edited after you approved it is asked about
again is Guard Policy's call, not this setting's: `strict` asks again, `relaxed`
and `off` continue with one line (see [Guard Policy](#guard-policy)).

**What keeps it on, and what turns it off everywhere.**

- A memory `## Guard Policy` section with `Mode: strict` (in `org.md`,
  `team.md`, or `project.md`) keeps plan approval on for everyone on the repo,
  express and poc included. Turning it off is refused with a sentence naming
  that file, and `/aidlc --status` shows
  `Plan Approval: on (guard policy strict (from project.md))`.
- The machine switch `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1` turns plan approval
  off for every piece of work on that machine, and it wins over the memory
  lock. It counts when the harness was launched with it (the session-start
  hook records it for that session), when it is recorded with
  `aidlc config flags --bypass AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD`, or when no
  harness session is recorded in the project (CI, a plain CLI run). A command
  that sets it for itself inside a session is read as if it were unset. Each
  plan built that way is recorded as skipped, with `Source` naming the
  switch.

**Changing scope** follows the new scope's value: moving from feature to express
turns plan approval off, and from express to feature turns it on. A value you
set yourself for this piece of work stays, and the memory lock still wins. This
differs from Guard Policy, where a lower scope default keeps the stricter value
until you ask for the lower value.

**Team mode.** Each Unit's plan is approved by that Unit's owner, in their own
checkout. With plan approval off it is built there without asking, and the
team merge accepts the skipped record in place of an approval.

**Kiro IDE.** A Kiro IDE build that passes hooks no message text cannot hear
a request to review the plan, so every plan is still shown for
approval there, and one line says that updating Kiro IDE lets plans build
without asking.

`/aidlc --status`, `/aidlc config get plan-approval`, and `/aidlc config list`
show the effective value and where it came from, for example
`Plan Approval: off (from scope poc)`.

### Guard Policy

Guard Policy is one setting with three values, `strict`, `relaxed`, and `off`. It decides how far the framework's guards stand aside for the piece of work you are on. It covers two things: what happens when something you already approved turns out to have changed underneath, and how hard the five fences hold against work nobody asked for.

**When an approved input changed.** A reviewed document was edited after its review, or an output was saved without the current summary confirmation.

- `strict` reopens the approval. The run stops with one plain sentence naming what changed and asks you again.
- `relaxed` and `off` keep going. The change is recorded once in the audit trail as a `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row, you hear one line about it, and the run continues. Nothing is deleted: the approval and its evidence stay exactly as they were.

Other code moving after you approved a code plan (a `git pull`, another Unit landing) never asks again, on any value: approving a plan is about the plan and its test instructions. The build continues, you hear one line naming what moved (for example `2 files changed since this plan was approved: src/api.ts, src/db.ts. Building auth now.`), and one `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row records it.

**How hard the fences hold.** `strict` leaves all five fences up. `relaxed` lowers plan re-approval and review freeze. `off` lowers those two plus state transition and reviewer read scope. No value lowers human presence or claimed-checkout Unit write ownership. A lowered fence still writes an audit row every time it lets something through.

**When the plan itself changes after approval.** For the same Unit or stage target and attempt, edits to the plan, test instructions, or Testing Contract continue without mandatory reapproval under `relaxed` or `off`. Under `strict` those edits reopen approval: the edited plan is asked about again. Either way, until the build starts you see one line saying what changed, such as "Your approved plan changed before the build: step 4 now says ... instead of ...", and saying "go back to the approved plan" (in any chat, also as `/aidlc go back to the approved plan`) puts back the plan, test instructions, and approval you gave. This is Guard Policy's call alone; the [plan approval](#plan-approval) setting decides only whether a plan is asked about in the first place. The same rule covers updates after Testing Posture, scope, test strategy, or project type changes within the same intent, target, and attempt: refresh the contract and instructions as needed, and continue while the fence stays lowered. The effective fence setting decides; `/aidlc --status` shows it. You can still ask to review the plan again.

Initial Plan Approval (while [plan approval](#plan-approval) is on) and other gates remain required. A lowered fence does not mean the edited content was approved: your original answer and approval evidence remain a record of what you actually approved. No reviewer's verdict is changed, no evidence is deleted, and an agent can never answer for you.

AI-DLC asks for Plan Approval itself: it shows the plan's summary and path with **Approve Plan**, **Request Changes**, and **I'll edit the files**, and the agent records the choice you make, from any chat on this piece of work, with your exact words beside it. "Approve, but add a test for the empty cart" is an approval plus an instruction: the agent adds it to the plan and the approval covers the plan as it stands then. You can also edit the plan or write your answer in `code-generation-questions.md`, then say done. It does not add a reapproval stop for content changes that a lowered plan-approval fence permits.

Existing delegated workers follow their verified parent intent's live
plan-approval setting. Lowering or raising it applies on their next check;
you do not need to recreate workers to apply that setting.

#### Defaults per scope

| Scope | Default |
|-------|---------|
| enterprise | strict |
| poc, express, classic, bugfix, feature, mvp, refactor, workshop, security-patch, infra | off |

`bugfix`, `classic`, `express`, `feature`, `infra`, `mvp`, `poc`, `refactor`, `security-patch`, and `workshop` ship with `off`. Because `classic` is the implicit default scope, work that names no scope starts with `off` too. On `enterprise`, `off` is something you ask for. A composed plan writes no scope file: a matched plan carries its stock scope's default or a stricter value you asked for, and a custom plan runs on a stock scope whose default is the value you approved at its gate, or lower. A plan you save as a scope stores its value as `guard_policy: <value>`.

Intent creation reads Guard Policy from the scope the plan runs on. The conductor passes `--guard-policy` for `strict` or `relaxed`, which raises a lower scope default, and never for `off`. If you lower a matched plan's Guard Policy at the compose gate, it becomes a custom plan on a stock scope that carries that value; if you raise it, the plan stays matched. Either way the intent takes the value at creation. The composer never changes an in-flight intent's value.

#### The three places to set it

1. **The scope file.** `guard_policy: strict | relaxed | off` in `scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` is the value every new intent on that scope starts with. Every shipped scope declares it; a scope file that declares none starts off, like every shipped scope but `enterprise`, so a plugin or composed scope that wants strict says `guard_policy: strict`.
2. **Memory.** A `## Guard Policy` section with one line, `Mode: strict`, in `aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/org.md`, `team.md`, or `project.md` holds strict for everyone on the repo. It wins over the scope default and per-intent values, and it keeps [plan approval](#plan-approval) on. An explicit `--guard-policy relaxed`, `--guard-policy off`, `/aidlc config set guard.<fence> off`, or turning plan approval off is refused with a sentence naming the memory file, and none of the command's companion settings or scope change is applied. Turning a fence `on` remains allowed. `Mode: relaxed` or `Mode: off` sets the policy for every piece of work whose value came from its scope (status shows it, for example `Guard Policy: off (from team.md)`), with the narrowest layer that declares one winning (`project.md`, then `team.md`, then `org.md`); a value you set for one piece of work keeps it, and a `Mode: strict` in any layer still wins over everything. An empty section changes nothing; any other value is a validation error naming the file and the three allowed values.
3. **The intent.** When you type `/aidlc --guard-policy relaxed|off`, `/aidlc config set guard-policy relaxed|off`, or the confirmation words `guard policy relaxed|off`, the human-turn hook applies the switch at prompt time to the selected piece of work and records the audit row (`/aidlc --status` shows it as `Guard Policy: relaxed (set by you)`). A typed command that includes other intent settings validates every value first and applies all of them under the same lock; a malformed command or invalid companion changes nothing. After a typed switch the conductor runs `next` and relays the stand-aside line or the `AIDLC Guard Policy: ...` hook context on harnesses that inject it. A plain-words request ("stop asking me to re-approve when files change", "be strict about changes") is carried out by the conductor: it runs `config-change --guard-policy <strict|relaxed|off>` with the value you asked for, which lowers when a reply from you is on record since the last decision, prints its output verbatim, and stops. If this Kiro IDE build delivers no prompt text, active work cannot be lowered: update Kiro IDE or start new work from a lower-default scope. Changing scope can raise a scope-owned policy automatically. A lower scope default follows when you asked for the scope change; any other scope change leaves the stricter value in place and says so in one line. Naming a scope's own default at creation records the scope's value. A sole retired `Change Control: relaxed|off` field is normalized automatically without changing its value or writing a policy audit row.

#### Where the value lives

The resolved value is written to the intent's `aidlc-state.md` at creation as `- **Guard Policy**: <value> (from scope <name>)`, rewritten by the flag, typed confirmation words, or a plain-words request the conductor carries out through the setter, and read by value only. Because the state file is committed with the intent, the value survives sessions and teammates see the same one; a memory edit that changes the effective value for a running intent is recorded as a `GUARD_POLICY_SET` row naming the memory file the next time a governed check runs. An intent created before this field existed stays `strict (not set)` until you set it, unless a memory file declares `relaxed` or `off`, which applies to it too; an invalid field is unavailable until `/aidlc --guard-policy` with one of the three values repairs it. The next intent starts from its scope's default again.

If a state file carries both `Guard Policy` and the retired `Change Control` with
different policy words, strict applies and status shows
`strict (from conflicting state lines)`; memory-held strict still takes precedence.
If both agree, the `Guard Policy` line is used. Any write of the policy line removes
the retired line, leaving one setting. Until a conflict is resolved, `next` carries
this notice with `<a>` and `<b>` replaced by the raw line values:

> This work has two settings for how closely AI-DLC checks changes, and they disagree, so AI-DLC checks everything for now. Do you want it to keep checking everything, carry on with a note when something you approved changes, or also skip some of its own checks? I'll ask again until you choose.

#### This setting used to be called Change Control

Every old spelling still works in this release and is removed in the next minor version: the scope key `change_control`, the state field `Change Control`, the memory heading `## Change Control`, the flag `--change-control`, and the config key `change-control`. Typing the retired flag or config key prints one line naming the new spellings; a retired scope key or memory heading is read without comment. Nothing writes an old name again: any write of the policy line removes the retired `Change Control` line, whether it was the only line or appeared beside `Guard Policy`. The `CHANGE_CONTROL_SET` audit event stays readable in older ledgers; new rows are `GUARD_POLICY_SET`.

While a piece of work carries only the retired `Change Control: relaxed` or `Change Control: off` line, every `/aidlc` run carries a notice in the directive's `change_notices`; displaying this notice does not automatically rewrite the line. For example: `This work still has an old setting that lets AI-DLC skip some of its checks (it asks you to confirm less often). Do you want to keep that, or have AI-DLC check everything again? I'll ask again until you choose.` Type `/aidlc config set guard-policy relaxed` or `guard policy relaxed` to have the human-turn hook keep that value and rewrite the line as `Guard Policy`, or request strict to have the conductor raise the fences through the setter; either write stops the notice. A retired strict line alone gets no notice and is rewritten the next time any Guard Policy setting is written.

### The five fences

A fence is a guard that refuses an action nothing asked for: no step the workflow is currently running calls for it. Three fences can be switched off for one piece of work and switched back on. The plan approval fence follows the [plan approval](#plan-approval) setting instead, and Guard Policy decides whether an edited plan is asked about again. Human presence is the key holder and has no per-work switch.

| Fence | What it refuses | Per-work switch | Machine-wide kill switch |
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Plan approval | code before its plan is approved, or with plan approval off, before the engine records that it builds without asking | none: `guard.plan-approval` is another name for the [plan approval](#plan-approval) setting | `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1` (turns plan approval off) |
| Review freeze | edits to reviewed content after a review receipt | `guard.review-freeze` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEW_FREEZE_HOOK=1` |
| State transition | direct lifecycle commands in place of the workflow's own | `guard.state-transition` | none |
| Reviewer read scope | a dispatched reviewer reading or searching sibling Unit content | `guard.reviewer-scope` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK=1` |
| Human presence | an approval or an answer with no real human turn behind it | none: the key holder has no in-band switch | `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` |

```
/aidlc config set guard.review-freeze off
/aidlc config set guard.review-freeze on
```

Lowering a fence or the policy word is the person's call. Ask in your own words and the agent runs the setter (asking for the guards as a whole to be off, such as "turn the guards off", sets Guard Policy `off`), or type `/aidlc config set guard.<fence> off`, `/aidlc --guard-policy relaxed|off`, or the confirmation words `guard policy relaxed|off`, choosing one value. The human-turn hook applies a typed switch at prompt time to the piece of work selected by `--intent <name>` and `--space <name>`, or by the hook payload session's workflow selection when those selectors are omitted, and writes the state and audit row. It reports `AIDLC Guard Policy: ...` as hook context on harnesses that inject it. A nonexistent named intent is refused. A Guard Policy `relaxed` or `off` switch typed before the work exists is for the piece of work this chat starts next (`Guard Policy relaxed for the piece of work you start now (set by you).`). Typed in the same message as a request, it goes with that request (`Guard Policy relaxed for the work you are asking for (set by you).`): new work takes it when it is created, and if you choose to continue the open work instead, it is applied there; the message alone never changes the open work. A fence switch such as `/aidlc --guard.review-freeze off fix the parser` works the same way (`The review freeze check is off for the work you are asking for (set by you).`). The one exception is while the code plan question is open and you are not editing the plan files: then a setting typed with words (`/aidlc --guard-policy off approve the plan`, or `strict` with your choice) is for this work, and the words are your reply to that question. Words after an unquoted `--` still describe new work. Plan approval `off` and a fence switch typed before the work exists are kept the same way, for the piece of work this chat starts next. No other switch is saved for later, and an unrelated reply opens nothing.

The CLI setters lower only when a reply from you has arrived since the last decision, and perform no switch-authority session lookup. An approval you give in the same message leaves the rest of it standing: "approve, and turn plan approval off" approves, then turns it off, and "approve the plan, and run Construction on its own from here" does both. Any other decision recorded after your message uses it up, and an approval always needs its own reply. Hooks run on Windows too, so the typed switch works on every harness that forwards the prompt. An already-off fence or an identical policy word already marked `set by you` needs no key because the CLI update is a no-op.

When a guard question offers "turn the check off for this piece of work", choosing it is enough: the agent turns it off for you and says in one line that it is off for this piece of work, comes back on for the next one, and that you can ask to turn it back on. On Codex the skill is `$aidlc`.

What counts as typing the switch: a message that begins with `/aidlc` (or `$aidlc`, or `aidlc`) and carries the flags first, such as `/aidlc --guard-policy relaxed`, `/aidlc --guard-policy off --guard.state-transition off`, or `/aidlc --guard-policy relaxed build the auth service` (the description follows the flags and is not read); `config set guard-policy relaxed|off` or `config set guard.<fence> off` after the same command head, followed only by optional `--intent <name>` and `--space <name>` pairs, each at most once and in either order; or the confirmation words `guard policy relaxed|off` on their own. Any other extra token in the config form applies no switch. Case and a trailing period do not matter. A question or remark that mentions a switch is not a switch: `/aidlc why was config set guard.plan-approval off suggested?` changes nothing, and neither does a flag placed after the description.

Direct `intent create --guard-policy relaxed|off` from chat is refused when the value is below the selected scope's default (`relaxed` on an `off` scope is a raise and applies): create the piece of work, and the agent runs the setter when you ask for the lower value. A value you typed before the work existed, or with the new work, is recorded as `set by you` for the work you asked for. Direct `scope change --guard-policy relaxed|off` follows the same lowering rule as `config-change`; a lower scope default applies when the person asked for the scope change; any other scope change keeps the running workflow's stricter value and says so in one line. `AIDLC_UNATTENDED=1` suppresses prompt-time application and refuses CLI lowering. After memory-strict and unattended checks, a CLI setter lowers without the person's prompt only when you typed it at your own terminal (your own act), or when `fenceKeyBypassed` recognizes the fixture or harness-launch presence bypass, not an inline environment assignment. The session-start hook keeps its `presence-bypass-<session>` stamp in the Plan Approval runtime directory for an attended harness launched with `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1`.

Model tools cannot invoke hooks or write `aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/` or any `.aidlc-plan-approval/` or `<record>/.aidlc-engine/gate-words/` directory, as enforced by the [state-transition guard](../reference/06-hooks-and-tools.md#pretooluse-aidlc-state-transition-guardts).

If a memory file holds Guard Policy strict, `/aidlc config set guard.<fence> off` is refused with a sentence naming that file; edit its `Mode: strict` line to change it for everyone on the repo. Turning a fence `on` remains allowed.

Memory-held strict also overrides a fence you lowered earlier. The persisted `Guards Off` entry stays in the intent, but `/aidlc --status` then leaves that fence off its `Checks off:` line; the entry takes effect again only after the memory line no longer holds strict. A machine-wide kill switch still takes precedence.

Switching one off writes `- **Guards Off**: review-freeze (set by you)` into `aidlc-state.md` and one `GUARD_DISABLED` audit row; switching it back on removes it from that list and writes `GUARD_RESTORED`. Setting `on` also raises a policy-lowered fence, records `- **Guards On**: review-freeze (set by you)`, and writes `GUARD_RESTORED`. The lines name only the switchable fences (a `plan-approval` entry written before plan approval became its own setting is still read); a persisted human-presence entry is ignored. `/aidlc --status` prints a `Fences:` line with all five and where each setting came from; the plan approval fence shows there as `plan re-approval`, the check on a plan edited after approval. Precedence is the machine-wide kill switch, then per-work off unless memory holds strict, then per-work on, then the Guard Policy word, then on by default. Setting the Guard Policy word yourself covers every check in its own direction (each change written as `GUARD_DISABLED` or `GUARD_RESTORED`): `off` clears the checks this work kept on, so none is left on, `strict` clears the checks it turned off, so none is left off, and `relaxed` clears neither, so it never turns a check back on or off. A memory-held strict still wins, and a single check you switch after it still applies.

The reviewer-scope setting governs the dispatched reviewer's read/search bound. A checkout stamped as owning one team Unit still cannot write another Unit's `construction/` subtree; that ownership boundary is not switchable by Guard Policy, a per-work fence setting, or `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK`.

Ask in your own words and the agent carries it out; the typed switch is a shortcut the human-turn hook applies as you type it. A switchable fence's main-session refusal names its switch. A setter that would turn a fence off, run when no reply from you has arrived since the last decision, says:

> Turning the review-freeze check off is the person's call. No reply from the person has arrived since the last decision: run it when they ask for it.

A CLI setter that would turn plan approval off says:

> Turning plan approval off lets code generation start without the person approving the plan, so it is their call. No reply from the person has arrived since the last decision: run it when they ask for it.

A setter that would change the policy to `relaxed`, run when no reply from you has arrived since the last decision, says:

> Setting Guard Policy relaxed lowers fences, which is the person's call. No reply from the person has arrived since the last decision: run it when they ask for it.

Creation with an explicit `relaxed` flag says:

> Creating this intent with Guard Policy relaxed would lower fences, which is the person's call. Create it, then, when they ask for it in their own words, run `aidlc engine config set guard-policy relaxed` yourself and say in one line what changed. A scope default applies without asking.

Other fence names and `off` use the corresponding name or value; unattended runs append the driver guidance. Memory-held strict refuses before applying a switch or checking a bypass and instead names the memory file to edit. A human-presence refusal names no switch; it says no reply from the person is on record and what happened to one they already sent (the harness's hook steps, or `/aidlc --doctor`), and never asks them to reply again.

Human presence is the strictest of the five. It is what makes your approval yours, so neither Guard Policy nor a per-work setting lowers it: only `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` does, set machine-wide or recorded with `aidlc config flags --bypass`, and AI-DLC tells you while it is off. `AIDLC_UNATTENDED=1` separately withholds human-turn minting; it does not lower the fence.

### Who asked for this: the authority chain

Every action a guard sees is classified before anything is decided. Is it covered by a recorded human turn, by the workflow's own instruction, or by neither? This classification records who was working; it is separate from the human-turn hook applying the person's typed switch.

- **Your grant.** A message you sent after the workflow last told the agent what to do. It classifies the conductor and agents dispatched for that turn until the workflow issues its next instruction; it does not authorize a fence or policy change.
- **The workflow's instruction.** The stage the engine currently has in force. It covers the work that instruction asks for, whoever does it, including an approval still pending inside it. It does not cover the loop skipping one of its own steps, which is exactly what a fence notices.
- **Neither.** Something outside the instruction with nothing from you since: the narrowest cover, and the one an unreadable signal falls back to.

The question is never who is typing. A developer agent acts on the conductor's word and the conductor acts on yours, so authority flows down the chain: when the conductor dispatches an agent, the authority in force at that moment is stamped on the dispatch and the agent inherits it. An agent can never mint a grant for itself, and an unreadable signal narrows what is covered rather than widening it. The signals are ones the framework already keeps: the turn markers under `.aidlc-engine/` that record your last prompt against the workflow's last advancing command, the counters on the active-directive marker, and the dispatch stamp on the in-flight agent ledger.

This classification never lowers a fence or substitutes for the person's typed switch. Its job is the evidence trail: every time a lowered fence lets something through, the audit row names the authority in force, so a reader can see who was working when it happened. A changed input under `strict` is asked about at the governed boundary regardless of this classification.

### What you see when a guard decides

- **It stands aside.** One line names what lowered the fence, and the work continues: `Continuing past the plan-approval check because it is off for this piece of work (guard policy off (from scope classic)). Recorded in the audit trail: dispatch of aidlc-developer-agent`. One `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` row records the fence, the authority in force, how a grant was proven, and whether the actor was the main session or a dispatched agent. You are never asked "are you sure": the fence is already off.

  On Claude Code the hook emits one JSON `systemMessage`, which Claude Code shows to you as a hook message; the model does not see it, and the `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` row is the record. On Codex, opencode, and Kiro CLI you see the plain hook line. On Kiro IDE you do not: the IDE hands a hook's output to the agent only at session start and at prompt submit, so a stand-aside there is silent and the audit row is the only record of it. A refusal is different: when a hook blocks a tool call, the agent does see the reason. The row is written only when the intent already has an audit trail, so on Kiro IDE against a brand-new project with no ledger yet a stand-aside leaves neither the line nor the row. If you want to know what a lowered fence let through, read the `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` rows in the intent's `audit/` shards rather than relying on having seen the line.
- **It holds.** When memory does not hold Guard Policy strict, a switchable fence's main-session refusal says what is missing and adds one sentence telling the agent to offer the way through: if you meant to do this now, it asks whether to turn the review-freeze check off for this piece of work, and when you say so it turns it off and tells you so in one line. When memory holds strict, the refusal names the memory file instead of offering a switch. Human presence instead says no reply from the person is on record, never asks them to repeat it, and never advertises a switch.
  Plan approval never names a switch: turning it off is only ever your idea. A plan you have not approved yet, or one edited after approval under `strict`, is asked about by running `next`.
  Dispatched agents never see the switch sentence; their refusals redirect them to the main session.
- **It asks.** Under `strict`, an input that changed after you approved something is asked about once, naming what changed.

## Stage Customization

Each stage is a self-contained `.md` file in `.claude/aidlc-common/stages/[phase]/`. Stage files specify:

- **Metadata** — Stage number, phase, execution mode, lead/support agents
- **Inputs** — Prior artifacts to load
- **Steps** — Numbered execution sequence
- **Outputs** — Artifacts to produce
- **Completion** — Approval gate pattern

To modify a stage's behavior, edit its stage file directly. All stages reference the stage protocol for shared patterns (approval gates, question format, state tracking).

### Depth levels

Each scope has a default depth that controls artifact detail:

| Depth | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Brief artifacts, targeted analysis, no optional content |
| **Standard** | Balanced detail, covers primary and secondary concerns |
| **Comprehensive** | Full detail, extensive analysis, all optional content included |

You can override depth at any approval gate by requesting a different level.

---

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

On **Claude Code**, this implementation displays a statusline in the terminal status bar showing workflow progress. The other harnesses have no statusline — they surface workflow position through `/aidlc --status` (Kiro, Cursor, opencode) and the `update_plan` task-progress item plus `$aidlc --status` (Codex):

```
[AIDLC] IDEATION [▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░] 4/7 > Intent Capture -- Product Agent
```

This shows, in order: current phase, phase progress (as a bar and a ratio — both scoped to the current phase), stage display name, and lead agent. Context usage appears on the right (e.g., `ctx:15%`), color-coded as the remaining context drops. When the Claude usage ledger has data, `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>` follows for the active workflow and current transcript/session only; prior workflows and sessions are excluded. Setting `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1` turns usage tracking off entirely and removes this segment.

The `$<usd>` value is a local estimate priced from **public list prices**, not a bill. When Amazon Bedrock is the recorded provider (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`), what Bedrock actually charges depends on your inference profile, region, service tier, and any negotiated or subscription pricing, so the figure may not match your invoice. Most of the token volume in a long workflow is cache reads — billed, at the reduced cache-read rate — so the counts and the estimate grow steadily; that is real usage, not inflation. To price new usage at your own rates, point `AIDLC_MODEL_RATES` at a rates file (see [Rate table and overrides](../reference/06-hooks-and-tools.md#rate-table-and-overrides)); totals already recorded keep the rates they were priced at. If you'd rather not show the estimate — while presenting, screen-sharing, or recording — set `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1` (see [Troubleshooting](15-troubleshooting.md#statusline-shows-a-cost-segment-you-dont-want-or-usage-tracking-concerns)).

### Configuration

The statusline is configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bun \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tools/aidlc.ts\" engine statusline"
}
```

### Customizing the format

Edit `.claude/hooks/aidlc-statusline.ts` directly. The output format is defined in the `main()` function near the end of the file. The hook reads phase, stage, and agent from `aidlc-state.md`, maps stage slugs to display names, and builds both the unicode progress bar and the `n/m` ratio from the same phase-local checkbox parse.

### Disabling the statusline

Remove the `statusLine` block from `settings.json`. The terminal status bar
reverts to Claude Code's default until the next `aidlc config --harness claude`
release refresh restores the shipped statusline. A custom, non-AI-DLC
`statusLine` command is kept on refresh; delete the key when you want to take
the shipped one again. No `--force` is needed.

---

## Tool Permissions

The `permissions.allow` list in `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves Claude Code tools so workflows run without per-call permission prompts:

```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "Edit(/**)",
    "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine *)",
    "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts doctor)", "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts --doctor)",
    "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config models --show --json)", "...",
    "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc-log.ts)", "Bash(bun .claude/tools/aidlc-log.ts *)", "...",
    "Task", "WebSearch"
  ]
}
```

`Edit(/**)` covers creating and changing files anywhere in the project: in project settings Claude Code anchors a leading `/` at the project root. Writes outside the project ask, as they do in Claude Code by default. Reading and searching inside the project needs no entry. The copy channel pre-approves only AI-DLC's own workflow commands, each listed as AI-DLC runs it: its engine commands, `doctor`, `version`, `--doctor`, `status`, the read-only `config <section> --show --json` and `--help` forms, and its `aidlc-*.ts` tools; the native release rewrites them to `Bash(aidlc engine *)`. A `config` change, the commands that change the machine's AI-DLC install (`use`, `update`, `rollback`, `uninstall`, `system`), and the tool scripts behind them match no entry, so you approve them in Claude Code's own prompt. There is no bare `Bash`: Claude Code matches every subcommand of a compound command on its own and strips only a fixed set of known-safe environment variables, so an engine command stays pre-approved only when it runs bare. A `cd ... &&` prefix, an absolute `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` path, a `VAR=1` prefix, a pipe into `jq`, or a `$(...)` capture all prompt. A project's own build and test commands sit outside the list and prompt once; answering "Yes, and don't ask again" saves a rule for them in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### How permissions work

- **Project-wide ceiling**: The `settings.json` allow list is the maximum set of tools available
- **Claude Code agents inherit the full session toolset** by default; `disallowedTools: Task` blocks nested subagent spawning on this harness
- **Optional per-agent narrowing**: An agent can be narrowed by adding a `tools:` allowlist to its frontmatter — omit it to inherit everything. Listing `tools:` drops inherited MCP tools unless the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids are also listed

### Expanding permissions

Only add tools to the allow list if you create custom stages that need additional capabilities.

### Narrowing permissions

Remove tools from the allow list to require manual approval for each use. Note that removing `Task` causes the four dispatched stages (2.1 Reverse Engineering pipeline, 2.2 Practices Discovery subagent, 2.4 User Stories mob, 3.5 Code Generation subagent) to prompt for permission on each delegation. Workspace detection (0.2) runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-create` — it does not use `Task`.

## Extending AI-DLC

The settings, scopes, depth, and stage edits above cover day-to-day tuning of a workflow you run. When you want to reshape the framework itself for your team — add a stage, add an agent, define a scope, teach a standing rule, wire a deterministic check, or add domain knowledge — that's a distinct job with its own guide: the **[Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md)**.

The dividing line is data versus code. Everything in that guide is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter or a JSON config that the framework reads — no TypeScript edits. Where to go for each extension:

| You want to… | Start at |
|--------------|----------|
| Edit what a stage does, or add a new stage | [Anatomy of a Stage](../harness-engineering/01-anatomy-of-a-stage.md), [Adding a Stage](../harness-engineering/02-adding-a-stage.md) |
| Add or modify an agent | [Adding an Agent](../harness-engineering/03-adding-an-agent.md) |
| Define or tune a scope | [Scopes](../harness-engineering/04-scopes.md) |
| Teach a standing rule, or operate the learning loop | [Rules and the Learning Loop](../harness-engineering/05-rules-and-the-loop.md) |
| Wire a deterministic check (sensor) into a stage | [Sensors](../harness-engineering/06-sensors.md) |
| Add team domain knowledge | [Team Knowledge](../harness-engineering/07-team-knowledge.md) |

If your change is to the framework's *code* — the orchestrator, a hook, a CLI tool, the compile pipeline — that's the [Developer Reference](../reference/00-overview.md).
