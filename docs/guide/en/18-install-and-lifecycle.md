# Install and Lifecycle

The native release channel installs an `aidlc` command and one
or more harness runtimes. `aidlc config` then creates or refreshes a project from
that local runtime. The installed command and config path do not require Bun or
Node.js. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is optional. A compatible version adds signed
attestation verification; missing or older versions do not block installation.

This chapter describes the native install lifecycle available in this release.
The planned `aidlc setup` experience, npm package, and package-manager formulas
are not available yet. Manual-copy users install Bun and take the versioned,
Bun-invoking runtime from `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`; they do not need the
native `aidlc` command.

## Install

Release assets cover:

- macOS x64 and arm64
- Linux x64 and arm64, with glibc and musl builds
- Windows x64

Native installs are per-user. The Unix installer refuses root and does not need
`sudo`. Windows installation targets the account running PowerShell. Run it
from a normal PowerShell window. A window opened with "Run as administrator"
under UAC is warned that installing as administrator is less safe, because
another program running as the same account could interfere with files the
elevated installer runs, and asked to confirm. `-Yes` confirms without a prompt;
a non-interactive run without `-Yes` (including `-Json` and `-Quiet`) stops with
that guidance. `aidlc uninstall` gives the same warning but asks nothing: at a
terminal it prints the warning before it removes anything, and with `--yes` the
warning is in its result. Sessions that already hold a full administrator
token without UAC elevation, such as the built-in Administrator on Windows
Server, see no warning. Running PowerShell with another account's credentials
installs for that account. There is no all-users mode.

Alpine Linux's musl asset follows Bun's own runtime contract: Bun's musl build,
like Node.js, requires the system `libgcc` and `libstdc++` packages. Fully
static Bun musl compile targets remain an upstream-tracked feature rather than
an available target today. Install the prerequisites before running the
installer or binary:

```sh
apk add libgcc libstdc++
```

This prerequisite applies to both x64 and arm64 Alpine systems. Installing the
system packages may require administrator rights, but the AI-DLC install itself
still runs as the target user. The installer detects the corresponding loader
failure and prints the command above; it never runs `apk` or installs system
packages. The upstream Bun tracking includes `oven-sh/bun#15829` and
`oven-sh/bun#29681`.

The installer includes `claude`, `kiro`, `kiro-ide`, `codex`, and `opencode`
together:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  -o "$tmp/install.sh"
sh "$tmp/install.sh"
rm -rf "$tmp"
```

### macOS and Linux

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  -o "$tmp/install.sh"
sh "$tmp/install.sh"
rm -rf "$tmp"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

An online run needs `curl` or `wget`; every run needs `sha256sum` or `shasum`.
GitHub CLI is optional and used only when it supports the release's required
attestation flags.
It installs
versions under `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/aidlc/versions/` and
links `$HOME/.local/bin/aidlc` to the active version by default.

The installer does not edit a shell startup file unless
`--profile <absolute-path-under-$HOME>` is explicit. That option writes or
updates one `BEGIN AI-DLC:PATH` block transactionally and preserves the rest
of the file. The profile cannot be inside the AI-DLC install or command roots;
existing markers must be unique, exact full lines, and ordered begin-before-end.
Malformed marker layouts are refused without changing the profile.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$download = Join-Path $env:TEMP "aidlc-install-$PID"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $download | Out-Null
$installer = Join-Path $download install.ps1
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 `
  -OutFile $installer
& $installer
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $download
```

Windows installs versions under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\versions\` and keeps a
stable `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\bin\aidlc.cmd` shim. After successful verification
and installation, the installer registers that bin directory in the current
account's persistent User PATH, preserving existing entries and avoiding
duplicates on reruns. It also updates the current PowerShell process and
notifies Windows of the environment change for new terminals. If another
session cannot find `aidlc`, open a new terminal; restart the terminal app or
IDE if needed.
It does not change Machine PATH or edit a PowerShell profile.

Successful human output starts with `Installed`, the version, the account,
and the installed command path. Next, run `aidlc config` from your project
directory. Restart guidance applies only if another terminal or IDE cannot
find the command.

The installer writes `windows-path.json` under the install root only when it
adds a User PATH entry. This ownership record survives reruns, including
`-NoModifyPath`, so uninstall can remove the entry later. An entry that was
already present is not claimed. Both `aidlc uninstall` and
`aidlc uninstall --purge` remove the recorded entry while preserving pre-existing
entries and later unrelated PATH changes.

If another `aidlc` command takes precedence in persistent PATH, the result
names it and gives the installed command's full path. Resolve that PATH
conflict or invoke the installed command directly. If PATH registration fails,
the installer reports that the files were installed but PATH still needs
configuration, with a recovery instruction and exit code 1.

To skip **both persistent and current-process PATH changes**, replace
`& $installer` above with `& $installer -NoModifyPath`. The installer prints
a direct command to run without PATH registration. For the default location:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\aidlc\bin\aidlc.cmd" config
```

Use the printed command path if you changed the install location. Rerun the
installer without `-NoModifyPath` to enable automatic PATH registration. The
switch does not undo an earlier registration or erase its ownership record.

PowerShell installer parameters use their native names, such as `-Version`, `-From`, `-Offline`,
`-ReleaseBaseUrl`, `-CaBundle`, `-NoModifyPath`, `-Yes`, `-Quiet`, `-Json`, and `-NoColor`.

An installer downloaded from a versioned release URL defaults to that exact
release, including previews. The `latest/download` installer continues to
select the latest stable release. An explicit `--version` / `-Version`
selection overrides the packaged default, while `--from` / `-From` reads the
version from the local release manifest.

### Automation

Installation asks no harness question. Human and non-interactive runs install
the same binary plus all harness runtimes.

For temporary or isolated Windows installs, pass `-NoModifyPath` and invoke
the reported `aidlc.cmd` path directly to keep the temporary bin directory out
of User PATH and the current process.

PowerShell `-Json` emits one result with `schemaVersion: 1`, `ok`, `code`,
`status`, and `message`. After the files are installed, `data` contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `installed` | `true`, including when the subsequent PATH step fails |
| `ready` | Whether the recommended command is ready to use; `false` for a PATH conflict or failure |
| `version`, `account`, `installRoot`, `command` | Installed version, Windows account, install root, and full command path |
| `path.scope` | `"user"` |
| `path.status` | `"updated"`, `"unchanged"`, `"skipped"`, `"conflict"`, or `"failed"` |
| `path.changed` | Whether this run changed persistent User PATH |
| `path.owned` | Whether this run confirmed installer ownership; `null` when `-NoModifyPath` leaves an earlier record unassessed |
| `nextSteps` | An array of instructions, including project configuration or PATH recovery |

Successful registration or an existing matching PATH normally uses
`status: "ok"` and exit code 0. If Windows cannot notify other applications,
the result uses `status: "warning"` with `data.ready: true` and a conditional
sign-out instruction. A persistent command conflict uses `status: "warning"`,
exit code 0, and `data.ready: false`; automation should inspect readiness as
well as the exit code. `-NoModifyPath` uses `status: "ok"`, `path.status: "skipped"`, and
`data.ready: true`, with a direct command in `nextSteps`. A PATH failure after
installation uses `status: "failed"`, exit code 1, `data.installed: true`, and
`data.ready: false`.

### Installer Options

| Unix | PowerShell | Meaning |
|------|------------|---------|
| `--version <version>` | `-Version <version>` | Install one exact release instead of latest: a stable `x.y.z` or a preview `x.y.z-preview.YYYYMMDD.N` id |
| `--from <dir>` | `-From <dir>` | Read a flat release set locally and imply offline mode |
| `--offline` | `-Offline` | Forbid network access; requires `--from` / `-From` |
| `--release-base-url <url>` | `-ReleaseBaseUrl <url>` | Use a compatible release mirror |
| `--ca-bundle <absolute-path>` | `-CaBundle <absolute-path>` | Use a custom CA bundle |
| `--profile <absolute-path>` | Not available | Transactionally add the Unix PATH block |
| Not available | `-NoModifyPath` | Skip persistent User PATH and current-process PATH changes; print a direct command |
| `--yes` | `-Yes` | Automation mode; it does not bypass integrity checks. On Windows it also replaces an `aidlc` in the bin directory that AI-DLC did not write, keeping that file as a backup |
| `--quiet` | `-Quiet` | Suppress progress and emit one result line |
| `--json` | `-Json` | Suppress progress and emit one schema-versioned JSON result |
| `--no-color` | `-NoColor` | Disable color output |
| `--help` | Not exposed | Print Unix installer usage |

`AIDLC_RELEASE_BASE_URL` and `AIDLC_CA_BUNDLE` provide installer defaults;
explicit options win. `AIDLC_RELEASE_REPOSITORY` selects both the GitHub
repository used for default downloads and the repository trusted by provenance
verification. It defaults to `awslabs/aidlc-workflows`.
`AIDLC_RELEASE_WORKFLOW` overrides the trusted signer workflow. By default,
installers select `<AIDLC_RELEASE_REPOSITORY>/.github/workflows/release.yml`
for stable versions and
`<AIDLC_RELEASE_REPOSITORY>/.github/workflows/preview-release.yml` for preview
versions. Set the override explicitly for a fork or mirror whose workflow path
differs, together with its release base URL; changing the download URL alone
does not change the provenance trust root. `AIDLC_GH_BIN` selects an explicit
GitHub CLI executable for both installers. If that executable is missing or
lacks `--signer-workflow`, `--source-ref`, or `--source-digest`, provenance
verification is skipped while checksum verification remains mandatory.

Fork releases need no GitHub App or additional repository. The tag workflow
publishes to the same repository with its short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Its final
job uses the `release` environment, which can require reviewer approval before
publication.

`AIDLC_INSTALL_ROOT` and `AIDLC_BIN_DIR` override the machine and command
locations. Those paths must be absolute on Unix. On Windows, the selected bin
directory is registered in the current account's User PATH unless
`-NoModifyPath` is set. The PowerShell installer also honors `AIDLC_OFFLINE=1`;
the Unix installer requires the explicit `--offline` or `--from` spelling.

### Release Authentication

The installer:

1. Downloads or reads `version.json`, `checksums.txt`, and
   `aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl`.
2. When a compatible GitHub CLI is available, verifies the `checksums.txt`
   attestation against the repository and signer workflow on `github.com`,
   even when the GitHub CLI's default host is a GitHub Enterprise host.
3. Verifies the `version.json` SHA-256, reads its version id and source
   identity, and rejects an explicit version mismatch before downloading or
   executing a release binary.
4. Requires `sourceRef` to equal `refs/tags/v<version>` for stable releases or
   `refs/heads/main` for previews and, when provenance verification is
   available, re-verifies the attestation against that ref and the
   authenticated `sourceDigest`.
5. Verifies the selected binary and harness archives by SHA-256 and declared
   byte length.
6. Lets the verified binary validate and transactionally install the release.

To authenticate the bootstrap script itself before execution, use a current
GitHub CLI. The `github.com/` repository prefix and `--hostname github.com`
keep these commands on github.com when your `gh` defaults to a GitHub
Enterprise host:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
tag="$(gh release view --repo github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows --json tagName --jq .tagName)"
gh release download "$tag" --repo github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows --dir "$tmp" \
  --pattern install.sh --pattern aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl
gh attestation verify "$tmp/install.sh" \
  --bundle "$tmp/aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl" \
  --repo awslabs/aidlc-workflows \
  --signer-workflow awslabs/aidlc-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --hostname github.com \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$tag"
sh "$tmp/install.sh" --version "${tag#v}"
rm -rf "$tmp"
```

Metadata is limited to 1 MiB and individual release assets to 1 GiB. Asset
names cannot contain paths. Archive extraction rejects links, special files,
path traversal, absolute paths, duplicate entries, and oversized expansion.

The release workflow assembles the candidate once. Staging and Unix/Windows
lifecycle jobs verify `checksums.txt` and test those bytes without signing
permissions. They add a job-local verifier fixture because the real
attestation is created after those tests. The fixture is never uploaded.
`publish` re-verifies the candidate, attests it, exports
`aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl`, validates the complete inventory, and uploads one
workflow artifact. `release` rechecks the tag and checksums, creates the GitHub
Release in this repository with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and compares the local and
remote asset inventories. The bundle remains outside `version.json` and
`checksums.txt`: those files cover the installable artifacts, while the bundle
is its own Sigstore trust channel.
Online transport enforces TLS and every install enforces SHA-256; compatible
GitHub CLI versions add signed provenance verification. OS code-signing and
notarization are not part of the release. See
[Supply-Chain Security](../reference/19-supply-chain-security.md).

The installer refuses an existing mixed-ownership command. It also yields to
an existing Homebrew or Nix command instead of replacing it. This project does
not yet ship those package-manager channels; use the owning manager or choose
an explicit empty `AIDLC_BIN_DIR`.

## Configure or Refresh a Project

Run config before opening the harness:

```bash
cd your-project
aidlc config --dry-run --json
aidlc config
aidlc doctor
```

`aidlc config` is local-only and transactional. It creates the selected harness
tree, the `aidlc/` workspace shell, root integrations, a projection stamp, and
an ownership baseline. It does not create a workflow intent.

When more than one harness is present, every `aidlc config` invocation must
include `--harness <name>`, including previews and refreshes. The one exception
is recording or clearing a bypass with `aidlc config flags --bypass` or
`--clear-bypass` and nothing else to change: a bypass belongs to the project,
not to one harness. See
[Root Integrations and Ownership](#root-integrations-and-ownership) for which
harnesses can coexist and how their shipped `.gitignore` entries are combined.

A run that writes one harness from a release then names every other installed
harness that is on another release, with the one command that brings it to the
release just written, whether or not work is open:

```
  Kiro CLI (.kiro) is still on 2.9.0. To bring it to 2.10.0: `aidlc config --harness kiro`.
```

When the files passed to `--from` hold that harness, the command reuses them.
Otherwise a copied project's line says to get that release's copy runtime file
first, because `--download` on a copied harness that is already installed
fetches the release it already has, and a native project's line names the
`aidlc config --pin` that installs that release.

After a successful scaffold or refresh, config runs a cheap installed-result
sweep. It checks only the non-interactive hook PATH, host trust files, and
recorded provider actions; it does not spawn the harness CLI or contact a
provider. The transaction still exits 0. Non-TTY human output names every
outstanding item and the exact `aidlc config runtime`, `aidlc config trust`, or
`aidlc config providers --check` follow-up. Codex's own hook trust is the one
item no AI-DLC command gives: its line names the step in Codex instead (type
`/hooks`, press `t` to trust all, then press Esc). JSON includes
`data.outstandingActions`, where such an item also carries that `step`. Quiet output stays one line when clean and appends
one outstanding-actions line when follow-up is required, plus one `Warning:`
line for each ignore rule that hides committed records.

On a human TTY, a bare first run starts with detection rather than questions:
installed harness CLIs on `PATH`, project state, local AWS credentials and
regions, and the non-interactive hook runtime. With one detected harness, the
wizard names it and offers three choices: recommended defaults, six-step
customization, or exit with nothing written. Multiple detected harnesses get a
numbered harness picker first; no detected harness gets the complete picker
without a default.

Before any setup choices, the wizard probes the project filesystem using
temporary files and directories, then removes them. It checks transaction
locking, exclusive file creation, regular-file `fsync`, mutable append and
readback, descriptor/path identity, file replacement by rename, directory
rename, Unix `chmod`, and runtime workflow-lock coordination. Unsupported
directory `fsync` is tolerated. These checks detect unavailable operations;
success cannot certify atomicity or crash durability. A failed probe stops
setup with storage remediation and nothing written (a probe that cannot be
removed is named instead); see
[Config fails with a hard-link error](15-troubleshooting.md#config-fails-with-a-hard-link-error).

Recommended defaults preserve the harness's current model provider.
Customization walks Harness, Model provider, Model effort preset, Plugins, MCP
servers, and the model-preset settings layer. The provider step offers keeping
the current provider first and Amazon Bedrock second. On Kiro CLI, step 2 is
Session model instead: it lists your Kiro account's models and saves the chosen
model, with the preset's session effort, in your personal Kiro settings, last,
after every AI-DLC step. Under Kiro auto, recommended defaults ask that one
model question; see
[Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort).
Every numbered prompt has
a bracketed default, invalid input re-asks in place, and each answer is echoed.
A check-your-answers table accepts Enter to apply or a step number to edit. No
files are written before that final gate. After apply, gerund receipts name the
project files and model-preset settings layer,
genuinely blocking actions follow, then the wizard prints the exact harness
launch and first workflow command.

Step 3 also offers a fourth option, `unchanged`, which records no preset and
preserves existing model settings; projects without model policy use shipped
defaults. `balanced` remains the recommended default, except on Kiro IDE,
Cursor, and GitHub Copilot: every agent there uses your session's model and
effort, so setup recommends and defaults to `unchanged`, and the rerun map
shows Models as `[ok]`, naming the host session.

An existing-project rerun keeps the eight-row map for Harnesses, Models,
Runtime, Flags, Project, Providers, Trust, and Workspace. Rows are lowercase
`[ok]` or `[needs]`; one default-yes gate walks only Models, Runtime,
Providers, and Trust findings. Workspace is reported, never walked: a missing
`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` shell is repaired by an explicit
`aidlc config --harness <name>` refresh, not by a question, and while the shell
is incomplete the gate is not offered at all: its sections would either fail on
the missing directory or, with no-op answers, rebuild nothing. The ledger then
leads with the rebuild command. On a Bun-invoking projection, one copied from the
`runtime/<name>/` root of `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` or from a checkout's
`dist/<name>/` tree, there is no installed runtime to refresh from, so that
command also carries `--download`, which fetches and verifies the copy runtime
for the project's release; a native install refreshes from its installed
runtime without it. A missing
`aidlc/` root is counted once: the Trust section's own
`workspace-root-missing` issue is folded into the Workspace row. The Providers
row reads `[ok]` with no recorded answer on Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE, which provide
their own model access, and on GitHub Copilot and Cursor, where no answer means
the session's own model access (for example `model access comes with your GitHub
Copilot session`); `aidlc config providers` records Amazon Bedrock there if you
bring your own (on Cursor, only the IDE takes Bedrock keys). On GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Kiro IDE the Models row
reads `[ok]` and names the host, for example `every agent uses your GitHub
Copilot session's model and effort`: those hosts cannot pin an agent's model or
effort, so there is no policy to ask for, and a recorded one is named as not
applying there. See [Choosing a Model and Effort](#choosing-a-model-and-effort).
Runtime leads with the immediate action and points to
`aidlc config runtime --show` for diagnostics. The closing ledger is a compact
label-to-command list. Section-named commands, non-TTY runs, `--dry-run`,
`--json`, and `--quiet` keep their deterministic output and never render the
interactive wizard.

### Config Options

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--project-dir <path>` | Target this project instead of the current directory |
| `--harness <name>` | Select an installed harness runtime |
| `--from <dir-or-tgz>` | Use local release files instead of an installed runtime: `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` (checked against a `.sha256` beside it), its extracted `runtime/` folder, or one projection directory or archive |
| `--download` | Fetch and verify the release the project needs when this machine lacks it, then finish the command; applying a dry run's plan token needs it again |
| `--mcp defaults\|none` | Add or omit Claude's optional shipped MCP entries |
| `--dry-run` | Calculate the complete plan without creating the target directory or changing bytes |
| `--plan-token <token>` | Apply only the exact plan approved from a JSON dry run |
| `--show` | Show settings without changing anything: with no section, every section in turn (`aidlc config --show`; `--json` prints one object keyed by section, each value what that section's `--show --json` prints); with a section, that section alone |
| `--force` | Replace locally modified framework-owned files and managed blocks where that policy permits |
| `--yes` | Confirm an otherwise unrecognized target directory or a section mutation; it does not imply MCP consent or choose a section answer |
| `--json` | Emit one result object with counts, actions, `data.notes`, and `data.planToken` |
| `--quiet` | Emit one summary or remediation line |
| `--no-color` | Disable color output |

### Model Policy

`aidlc config models` records model policy in the selected settings layer
(`aidlc.settings.json` for `--project`) and applies it through the normal config
plan, confirmation, and transaction. It never contacts a model
provider. On Kiro CLI, choosing a session model asks Kiro CLI for your account's
model list and that model's effort levels; with `--yes`, only `--session-model`
does.

The public groups are:

| Group | Agents | Shipped tier |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Deciding | 9 design, implementation, product, security, and quality agents | judgment |
| Reviewing | product lead and architecture reviewer | balanced |
| Writing up | delivery, pipeline and deploy, and operations | templated |

Policy resolves per agent in this order:

1. Per-agent exception
2. Group dial, set directly or through a preset
3. Shipped tier default
4. Session inherit

Pins bind in both directions. A pinned agent stays pinned if the session later
moves to a larger model. The framework never raises an agent above the session
on its own. With no recorded policy, Deciding and Writing up inherit; only the
measured reviewing tier baseline ships a step-down. The first-run wizard's
default choice records the `balanced` preset, which sets all three groups to
medium effort; on Kiro IDE, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot it records no preset.

```bash
aidlc config models --show
aidlc config models --reviewing-effort xhigh --project --yes
aidlc config models --agent architect --effort xhigh --model provider/raw-id --project --yes
aidlc config models --check
aidlc config models --reset --project --yes
aidlc config models --session-model claude-opus-4.8   # Kiro CLI: your personal session model
```

A change ends with what changed, its undo command and who picks it up (plus
any setup step still outstanding); `--json` and `--quiet` output are unchanged.

`--show --json` prints every agent's effective model, effort, and provenance.
`--check` is the CI inverse and exits non-zero when the recorded policy is not
fully reflected in the harness surfaces.

Model and flag policy resolves leaf-by-leaf through this hierarchy:

1. Shipped defaults in the tier and preset tables
2. Machine `${AIDLC_INSTALL_ROOT:-~/.local/share/aidlc}/aidlc.settings.json`
3. Project `aidlc.settings.json`
4. Personal `aidlc.settings.local.json`
5. Environment variables

Bypasses add up instead of overriding: a switch is on while any of the three
files records it.

The project file is committed team policy. The local file is personal: AI-DLC's
managed `.gitignore` block lists it, and on an install whose `.gitignore`
predates that, the config command that creates it adds it to the clone's own
`.git/info/exclude` instead. Neither file counts as the team's code. Mutations
require exactly one of `--project`, `--local`, or `--global`, except a bypass:
`--bypass` with no layer records in the local file, and `--clear-bypass` with
no layer clears every file that records it. The interactive wizard asks for the
layer and recommends project policy inside a repository. Outside a recognized
project only the machine layer is valid, so `--global` is inferred. `--show`
labels each effective value with its winning source.

All three files use one strict schema. Unknown keys fail closed, and
update/release keys such as `offline` and `release-base-url` are machine-only.
Editors can reference the generated
`<harness>/tools/data/aidlc-settings.schema.json`; no defaults settings file is
written.

Three immutable effort-only presets ship:

| Preset | Deciding | Reviewing | Writing up |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `thorough` | session effort | `xhigh` | session effort |
| `balanced` (wizard default) | `medium` | `medium` | `medium` |
| `minimal` | `medium` | `medium` | `low` |

Presets never set model IDs. Explicit group dials and per-agent exceptions can
override the preset's efforts. On Kiro CLI, which runs each session on one
model, each preset is one session effort instead: `minimal` low, `balanced`
medium, `thorough` xhigh, or the model's next level down
([Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort)).

On upgrade, an install that recorded `preset: balanced` or `preset: minimal`
picks up these efforts the next time its projections are regenerated. After
`aidlc update`, run `aidlc config --yes` between workflows to reapply the
recorded policy, or explicitly select it with
`aidlc config models --preset balanced --project --yes` (substitute `minimal`
as needed). Update changes only the machine runtime; doctor and
`aidlc config models --check` report issues without applying changes. Installs
with no recorded model policy keep the shipped tier defaults and are unaffected.

Derive a project profile from a preset or an existing profile:

```bash
aidlc config models --from thorough --reviewing-effort medium \
  --save-as my-profile --project --yes
```

Presets and profiles contain group efforts only. Raw model IDs are allowed only
on per-agent exceptions. `--yes` confirms a mutation but never chooses a
policy. Without decisive flags, a TTY opens the model policy wizard; a non-TTY
run fails with usage guidance.

Harnesses receive only settings they can read. Codex clamps `max` effort down
to `xhigh`. opencode clamps `xhigh` down to `high`. On Kiro CLI a preset sets
one effort for the whole session, saved with the session model in your personal
Kiro settings
([Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort));
explicit group dials have no Kiro surface, and a per-agent model exception
carries its effort through the project's `chat.modelDefaults`, which then
replaces your personal effort map in that project. An effort set on Kiro CLI
without a model is kept for other tools, and the command says so in one line.
Kiro IDE, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot cannot portably pin
agent models or effort, so setup records no preset there. A model or effort you
set anyway is kept for teammates on tools that apply it, writes no inert keys,
and the command says in one line that this tool uses the model you choose in its
own model picker. On those three, every agent uses the session's model and
effort: the setup check and `aidlc doctor` say so instead of asking for a
policy, and doctor warns only about an agent model recorded for that harness
by name.

Model policy is agent-scoped. Stage files never carry model or effort keys;
scopes continue to own stage criticality.

### Choosing a Model and Effort

AI-DLC works best with a capable reasoning model; the recommended model is
Claude Opus 4.8. Where you set the model and effort depends on the harness:

- **GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Kiro IDE:** in the host, for the whole session.
  Every agent uses the model and effort of the chat you run `/aidlc` in, and
  nothing AI-DLC records changes that. On Kiro IDE, a `model:` line you add
  to an agent's `.md` file by hand changes that agent until the next refresh
  (see [Customization](13-customization.md)); on Copilot such a pin is not
  portable, because the CLI and VS Code read model names differently.
- **Claude Code, Codex CLI, and opencode:** the session's model and effort
  drive the conductor and every agent that inherits; `aidlc config models`
  can set agent efforts (the `balanced` preset sets them to medium) and
  per-agent exceptions.
- **Kiro CLI:** the session model and its one effort. `aidlc config models`
  saves them in your personal Kiro settings (a preset sets the effort:
  `minimal` low, `balanced` medium, `thorough` extra-high); `/model` and
  `/effort` change them inside Kiro. See
  [Session model and effort](harnesses/kiro-cli.md#session-model-and-effort).

If your organization offers only a mid-tier model, such as a Claude Sonnet
model, without Opus:

- **Start the session at medium effort.** A workflow runs many turns, and
  higher effort makes the model think longer on every one of them, so high or
  maximum effort makes the whole run much slower and more expensive. Medium is
  what the `balanced` preset gives agents on harnesses that can set them.
- **Raise effort only for a stage that needs it,** for example Code Generation
  on a hard Unit, then lower it again. On GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Kiro IDE,
  and Kiro CLI that is the session's effort. On Claude Code, Codex CLI, and
  opencode, Code Generation runs on the developer agent, which follows the
  session only while no preset or effort is recorded for it. Otherwise its
  effort is the recorded one: to raise it, record it, for example
  `aidlc config models --agent developer --effort high --project --yes`. That
  works while a workflow is open too: config rewrites the developer agent's
  file, and the harness uses it the next time it starts the agent (Claude Code
  does so at the agent's next start; a step already running keeps what it
  started with). The command prints the one that puts it back.
- **Change model or effort between stages, in a new chat.** See
  [Changing Model Mid-Workflow](11-session-management.md#changing-model-mid-workflow).

Running a workshop? The [Facilitator Guide](facilitator-guide.md) covers the
readiness check and keeping each run small.

### In-session alias

`/aidlc --config [section]` is the conversational alias for these same config
sections. The conductor reads the current JSON state before asking, gathers
only the changes you want, and lands each accepted section through one exact
`aidlc config <section> <explicit value flags> --yes` command. Leaving a
section unchanged runs no command. After landing or declining, the alias stops;
it never advances or resumes workflow work.

### Runtime Diagnostics

`aidlc config runtime` checks the environment that project hooks actually use.
On Linux it derives a non-interactive baseline from `getconf PATH` plus the
`PATH` lines of `/etc/environment`, `ENV_PATH` in `/etc/login.defs`, and
`environment.d`. On macOS it uses `getconf PATH` plus `/etc/paths` and
`/etc/paths.d`. On Windows it reads the User and Machine PATH without loading a
shell profile. It then resolves the command required by the installed hook
bytes (`bun` for copy projections or `aidlc` for native projections) and checks
the selected harness CLI.

```bash
aidlc config runtime --show
aidlc config runtime --check
aidlc config runtime --record-paths --yes
aidlc config runtime --reset --yes
```

`--record-paths` records the resolved answers in `harness.json`. It does not
rewrite hook commands. Host permission rules and Codex hook trust bind the bare
`bun` or `aidlc` command prefix, so replacing it with an absolute path would
invalidate the existing trust contract. When a command is interactive-only or
absent, the section gives a platform-specific PATH instruction instead.

`/aidlc --doctor` shows the same probe as its `Runtime hook PATH` row. When the
command is only on the current shell's PATH but this project's hooks are firing
(a heartbeat under `.aidlc-engine/hooks-health/` from the last ten minutes that
is not stale, from a launch that has not ended since), the row passes and names when they last fired: the harness
evidently hands its hooks that PATH. Otherwise it warns, names the directory
the command was found in, and says that a harness started from a terminal
needs no change and that editing `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` does not change the
check.

The harness CLI check requires `claude`, `kiro-cli >= 2.6.0`, `codex >= 0.145.0`, or
`opencode` for their matching harnesses. Copilot CLI and the Cursor `agent` CLI
are advisory because those installs may be driven only by VS Code or the IDE.
The `kiro-ide` distribution requires no separate CLI; `kiro-cli` is optional there, needed only to run AI-DLC from a terminal, and is checked against 2.24.1 when present.

### Provider Diagnostics

`aidlc config providers` records provider answers for this project install.
Keeping the provider already configured in the harness is the default answer.
Amazon Bedrock is an explicit opt-in. Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE are not asked because
model access comes with Kiro. `other` remains available for a manually configured
provider and carries an acknowledgement reminder.

```bash
aidlc config providers --provider current --yes
aidlc config providers --provider amazon-bedrock \
  --region us-east-1 --profile default --yes
aidlc config providers --show --json
aidlc config providers --check
aidlc config providers --mark-done bedrock-model-access --yes
aidlc config providers --reset --yes
```

`--region`, `--profile`, and `--opencode-default` apply only when the recorded or selected provider is `amazon-bedrock`.

Credential detection is offline only. It inspects AWS environment variables,
`~/.aws/config`, `~/.aws/credentials`, role and container credential variables,
and the AWS SSO cache. It never calls STS, Bedrock, a model endpoint, or any
other network service.

Recorded Bedrock answers apply through the normal staged config transaction:

| Harness | Recorded answer application |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| Claude Code | Enables Bedrock and writes `AWS_REGION` plus optional `AWS_PROFILE` in `.claude/settings.json`; also keeps the AWS MCP URL and `AWS_REGION` metadata in `.mcp.json` on the same region |
| Codex CLI | Records the choice and instructs the user to keep provider, credentials, and model in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Kiro CLI | No provider answer; model access comes with Kiro |
| Kiro IDE | No provider answer; model access comes with Kiro |
| opencode | Offers to write `provider.amazon-bedrock.options.region/profile` to `opencode.json`; `--opencode-default yes|no` records the answer |
| GitHub Copilot | Records acknowledgement of the manual BYOK environment setup |
| Cursor | Records acknowledgement of the manual provider and model-picker setup |

Bedrock model access and IAM permission verification cannot be automated
offline. The record therefore carries named pending actions. `--show` lists
them, `--check` stays non-zero while they are pending, and
`--mark-done <id>` records completion. Codex provider setup remains explicitly
self-attested after completion because the effective user configuration and
alternate credential channels cannot be resolved offline; `--check` returns
success with that warning instead of describing the setup as verified.
`--provider current` preserves the harness's configured provider and removes
only Bedrock values AI-DLC can attribute to its shipped defaults or the previous
record from Claude, Codex, or opencode project files. Customized Claude model
aliases are preserved. A customized legacy Codex Bedrock block is also preserved;
`--check` reports a warning when it still names that provider instead of calling
the configuration clean. `--provider other` records a manually configured
non-Bedrock provider and reports that setup as pending until `--acknowledge` is
supplied. `--reset` removes exact legacy AI-DLC Bedrock defaults or values written
for the previous recorded answer from Claude, Codex, and opencode project files;
unproven values are preserved.

The question is worded for the harness in front of you, so each install offers
the two paths that actually exist for it:

| Harness | `amazon-bedrock` records |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | the AWS region and profile in `settings.json`, and the AWS MCP region in `.mcp.json` when present |
| Codex CLI | the AWS region and profile in the project record, then guides user-level provider setup in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` |
| OpenCode | the AWS region and profile, and offers to write them to `opencode.json` |
| GitHub Copilot | that you set the Copilot BYOK provider variables yourself |
| Cursor | that you configure the provider in Cursor yourself |


Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE provide their own model access, so AI-DLC configures no
model provider for them. `aidlc config providers` states that model access
comes with Kiro and asks nothing; so does the first-run wizard on Kiro IDE, while
on Kiro CLI its step 2 chooses the session model instead. Provider flags are
refused, and the Providers row reads `[ok]` regardless of a legacy record.
`aidlc config providers --reset --yes` clears a record left by an earlier build.
`builtin` records from the previous build still load and read as harness-managed,
with no pending actions. Legacy Kiro Bedrock records are also ignored, including
their pending actions, and nothing is written from them. The `aws-mcp` region in
`.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is plain MCP configuration, not a model-provider
answer: whatever region that file carries, whether an earlier build's Bedrock
answer put it there or you did, is kept across refreshes, and `--reset` leaves
the file alone.

Every other harness asks whether to keep its current provider or opt in to
Amazon Bedrock. Keeping the current provider is the default, including when AWS
credentials are detected. Copilot and Cursor reach Bedrock through their own
BYOK or provider settings, which AI-DLC tracks as a pending action rather than
performs.

On Kiro, `--check` says no answer is needed and exits zero even with a legacy
record. On GitHub Copilot and Cursor with no answer, `--check` and `doctor` say
no answer is needed because model access comes with the session, and `--check`
names the command that records your own Amazon Bedrock access. On every other unrecorded
section it names that state instead of reporting a verified answer, and still
exits zero because the shipped fallback bytes remain valid.

On these harnesses `keep current` is the first answer and the default.
`amazon-bedrock` is the second answer. Re-entering the section with the recorded
answer preserves it: Bedrock keeps its region and profile unless you explicitly
replace them, while `other` keeps its pending manual-setup action. Pending
actions can still be completed with `--mark-done`.

### Trust Diagnostics

`aidlc config trust` reads and verifies host-native trust. It never regenerates
trust seeds, permission rules, or IDE settings.

```bash
aidlc config trust --show
aidlc config trust --check
aidlc config trust --acknowledge --yes
aidlc config trust --reset --yes
```

For Codex, the check requires the complete project-specific trust seed entry
set in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`. The two supported remedies are one TUI
`Trust all and continue` pass or replacing `<PROJECT_DIR>` and merging the
complete seed. Until then zero Codex hooks fire.
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` does not fire untrusted hooks, and appending
a second seed set produces invalid TOML.

For the `kiro-ide` distribution, trust ships in the conductor's `permissions`
(`.kiro/agents/aidlc.md`), so the check adds nothing there; Kiro IDE 1.x no
longer reads `.vscode/settings.json` `kiroAgent.trustedCommands`. `--show` lists
the selected harness's trust and allowlist files.

For Copilot, the check reads the Copilot CLI's `trustedFolders` (in
`config.json` under `COPILOT_HOME`, else `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot` on Windows
and `~/.copilot` elsewhere) and warns when it does not cover the project; a
folder above the project counts. VS Code never reads that list: its hooks need
a trusted workspace and the Chat: Use Hooks setting on, which AI-DLC cannot
see, so the Trust row names them. When the CLI has not trusted the project,
`aidlc config trust` (and the setup walk) says how: run `copilot` in the
project once and choose "Yes, and remember this folder for future sessions".
AI-DLC never edits the CLI's `config.json` itself, since trusting a folder lets
its code run.

The trust check also verifies the project siblings that copy installs often
miss: `aidlc/` for every harness, `.agents/` for Codex, and the `.aidlc/`
engine for opencode and Copilot.

Doctor also classifies the installed instruction file against the config
ownership baseline. An intact managed block reports `block present, user
content preserved`; a missing block or file says to run `aidlc config`; a
hand-modified managed block or framework-owned whole file reports a conflict.
The row follows the invoking harness when more than one harness tree is
present.

### Project Flags

`aidlc config flags` records project answers for default scope, swarm mode,
hook debug, sensor timeout, question retention, and explicit guard bypasses or
ceremony kill switches:

```bash
aidlc config flags --default-scope <installed-scope> \
  --swarm on --hook-debug off --sensor-timeout-ms 90000 \
  --question-retention-days 30 --project --yes
aidlc config flags --bypass AIDLC_SKIP_ARTIFACT_GUARD --local --yes
aidlc config flags --show
aidlc config flags --check
aidlc config flags --reset --project --yes
```

Real environment variables always win. Existing tools and hooks first read the
environment and then resolve local, project, and machine settings when the
variable is absent. This keeps CI and one-shot shell exports scriptable.

`--question-retention-days <days|unlimited>` controls how long AI-DLC keeps its
copy of a request for a question that was never answered. The default is
unlimited unless a positive integer is recorded. With a value set, copies older
than that many days are removed the next time AI-DLC does work (status, help,
and other queries never remove anything), and an expired question is refused if
it is answered. Passing `unlimited` removes
the value from the selected settings layer without changing other flags.
`AIDLC_QUESTION_RETENTION_DAYS` is the matching environment override.

Default scope names are read from the installed scope files. The section does
not branch on a built-in scope name, so scope renames and plugin scopes remain
data. On Claude Code, config also rewrites the staged
`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` value in `.claude/settings.json`; otherwise the
shipped session environment would shadow the lower-precedence record.

The recordable bypass set includes the documented recovery and ceremony switches:

- `AIDLC_SKIP_ARTIFACT_GUARD`
- `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD`
- `AIDLC_SKIP_REVISION_BACKSTOP`
- `AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_ENSEMBLE_EVIDENCE`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEW_FREEZE_HOOK`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING`
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS` — disables sensor execution and sensor gate checks
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS` — disables the stage learnings ritual
- `AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION` — disables the separate summary-confirmation checkpoint, not stage approval

The wizard never offers bypasses. They require an explicit `--bypass <name>`;
`--show` surfaces every enabled bypass and its guard-weakening consequence.
Recording or clearing one prints only what changed with its undo command and
the line for the check it switched (plus any setup step still outstanding);
`--json` and `--quiet` output are unchanged.
Every bypass except usage tracking, sensors, and learnings takes a check away
from the person, so while one is on AI-DLC says so in one line: on the next
step, at the start of every chat (not on opencode, which shows no session-start
context), in `--show`, and in the doctor Flags row. The
line names the check, since when, how it was set, and the `--clear-bypass`
command that turns it back on (see "Environment kill switches" in
[CLI commands](12-cli-commands.md)).

Four of these switch off a fence for the whole machine. When the problem is one
piece of work rather than one machine, `/aidlc config set guard.<fence> off`
lowers a single fence for that work only, records it, and puts it back for the
next piece of work. See
[Guard Policy](13-customization.md#guard-policy) and
[The five fences](13-customization.md#the-five-fences).

### Project Choices

`aidlc config project` records the installed plugin selection, MCP consent,
and the shell-completion answer:

```bash
aidlc config project --plugins aidlc,test-pro --mcp none \
  --completions zsh --yes
aidlc config project --show --json
aidlc config project --check
aidlc config project --reset --yes
```

On a copy-channel projection, `config project` applies plugin, MCP, and
completion choices from the project's own files at the release it already
has, so it needs no download. Turning MCP back on reads the shipped server list
the harness folder keeps. It needs the release only when the project is pinned
to another one, or when that list is missing from the harness folder; it then
asks at a terminal, and scripts add `--download`.
`--from <path>` instead uses files you downloaded: `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`,
its extracted `runtime/` folder, or one harness root. Servers you added to
`.mcp.json` yourself are never recorded or removed.

Plugin names are discovered from the installed graph, scopes, and plugin
sidecars. They are not hardcoded. The selection continues to use the existing
top-level `plugins` array in `harness.json`, so graph and runner regeneration
use the same selection seam as plugin composition. A project change while a
workflow is open is done, like any refresh (see "Refresh Safety"), and says
what changed with the command that puts the earlier choice back when one
command can say it. Turning off a plugin that open work needs names that work:
it continues once the plugin is on again. Add `--dry-run` to the same command to preview its plan
without changing project or settings files.

MCP consent remains `defaults` or `none`. A non-interactive project mutation
with no earlier consent records `none`, unless `.mcp.json` already holds a
shipped server as shipped: then it records `defaults` and keeps the servers
there, adding none. `--yes` only confirms the mutation and never adds MCP
entries.

On Claude Code, `.mcp.json` is the consent-managed surface: `--check` verifies
both `defaults` and `none`, and later plain config refreshes reapply the answer.
Kiro CLI always ships `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`; `defaults` is satisfied by
that file and its five shipped servers, while `none` is an instruct-only
preference and does not remove a framework-owned file. The current Codex,
opencode, Copilot, Kiro IDE, and Cursor distributions ship no MCP surface, so
their recorded answer is informational and does not make `--check`
permanently red. `--show` names the actual MCP file whenever one exists.

Completions are instruction-only and write no machine files. Native installs
print commands such as:

```bash
eval "$(aidlc system completions bash)"
```

Copy-channel installs print the matching Bun invocation, for example:

```bash
eval "$(bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts system completions bash)"
```

Fish uses `... completions fish | source`; PowerShell uses
`... completions powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression`.

An existing project stamp fixes the harness for a refresh. A fresh interactive
project prompts for a harness; a non-interactive run requires `--harness`.
If `.aidlc-version` exists, config
requires a source at that exact version with the matching project harness.

Config recognizes directories containing `.git`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`,
`go.mod`, or `pyproject.toml`. Outside those shapes, interactive mode asks for
confirmation and non-interactive mode requires `--project-dir`.

Claude's optional MCP integration defaults to `none` without a TTY. A human
TTY is prompted when no prior choice exists. `--yes` and `--json` do not grant
MCP consent. Reliable automation supplies `--project-dir`, `--harness`, and
`--mcp defaults|none` explicitly; JSON controls output but does not disable
TTY prompts by itself.

For exact scripted approval:

```bash
token=$(
  aidlc config --project-dir "$PWD" --harness claude --mcp none \
    --dry-run --json | jq -r .data.planToken
)
aidlc config --project-dir "$PWD" --harness claude --mcp none \
  --plan-token "$token" --json
```

Use identical source and behavior options for both calls. Source bytes,
options, or project state changing after the preview changes the token and
the apply fails closed.

### Refresh Safety

Any `aidlc config` you run while work is open is done, not refused, parked
workflows included. A settings change (`config models`, `flags`, `runtime`,
`providers`, and `trust`) reads the project's own files and brings in no
release. Each prints what changed and, where one command
puts the earlier value back, that command. A model or flag change also names
the open workflows that pick it up: a bypass, hook debug, the sensor timeout,
and question retention apply right away, with no restart; models and swarm
apply from the next step (a step already running keeps what it started with),
except that on Kiro CLI a model or effort change applies from your next Kiro CLI
session, since a running one keeps what it started with;
a default scope applies to new work only, and a saved model profile changes
nothing until `--from` loads it. The runtime, providers, and trust answers
print no workflow line.

A refresh that brings in release files (a plain `aidlc config`, `--from`,
`--download`, `config project`, or the update a pinned project needs first)
is done too, and says so:

```
  Updated. Your open work (default/add-login) carries on.
```

When the files came from another release, the next line says how to go back:

```
  To go back: `aidlc config --pin 2.9.0 --yes` (this pins the version for everyone on the project; `aidlc config --unpin` removes the pin).
```

On a project that is already pinned it gives only the `--pin` part. On a
copied project the line names the earlier release's file instead: get
`aidlc-copy-runtime-2.9.0.tar.gz` and its `.sha256` into one folder, then run
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config --from <that file> --yes`. A harness
added beside open work comes from the files you name, and its line names the
folder it added (`Added .codex. Your open work (...) carries on.`); no command
removes a harness, so there is no undo line.

Refresh preserves:

- all workspace records, audit shards, knowledge, and other project files
  absent from the shipped projection
- existing `aidlc/active-space` and space memory files, which are
  project-owned seeds
- every non-identity sibling key in mutable `tools/data/harness.json`,
  including plugin selection and future policy records
- plugin-composed files and recorded stage contributions, then regenerates
  graph, runner, scope, and compiled table surfaces
- upstream-authored orchestrator prose while rebuilding its compiled stage and
  scope regions from the preserved project composition
- what a host tool installs for itself inside a folder AI-DLC manages, such as
  the `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and `node_modules/` (links included)
  opencode writes under `.opencode/` at its first start: config never copies,
  owns, or removes these

Under `aidlc/`, install and refresh copy only those seeds. The clone identity,
sessions, engine health, and other per-machine state are never copied from the
installed runtime or recorded in the install baseline.

Locally modified framework-owned files conflict against the prior baseline.
`--force` replaces those files with the refreshed candidate, including local
edits to hand-authored orchestrator prose. It does not claim unrelated
project content. Line endings alone are not a local change: Git rewrites them
on checkout (Git for Windows checks LF files out as CRLF by default), so a
clone, branch switch, stash pop, or new worktree of a configured project
refreshes without conflicts. `aidlc doctor` names the files a refresh would
refuse in its `AI-DLC files` row.

An unchanged framework file the new release no longer ships is removed, and
config names each one: the refresh prints `Removed N files that are no longer
part of AI-DLC <version>:` and the list, and `--dry-run` prints the same list
as `Will remove`. Several files in one folder show as one line. When git
tracks every removed file, config also names `git restore <path>` to get one
back; later refreshes leave a restored file alone. In JSON these actions carry
`detail: "no longer shipped"`.

`.claude/settings.json` belongs to the project; AI-DLC contributes entries
rather than owning the whole file. Release refreshes, including those
accompanying provider, scope, or model answers, merge those entries without
ownership conflicts, and `--force` does not change this.

For Claude, refresh restores AI-DLC hook registrations to their shipped
events, matchers, and commands, then appends your own hook groups. It puts the
shipped `permissions.allow` entries first and keeps your additional allow
entries, `deny`, `ask`, and other permission keys. Retired shipped allow
entries are not removed automatically. A missing or AI-DLC `statusLine` is
refreshed; your custom non-AI-DLC statusline is kept. `companyAnnouncements`
is refreshed when absent or still matching its shipped baseline, otherwise
your value is kept. Delete either custom key and refresh to take the shipped
one. Environment and other top-level settings (including `disableAllHooks`)
stay yours, except for values attributed to recorded provider or project
answers.

`.codex/config.toml` belongs to the project as well; AI-DLC contributes its
settings key by key: `developer_instructions`, `sandbox_mode`,
`suppress_unstable_features_warning`, `tool_output_token_limit`, and the keys
it ships in the `[shell_environment_policy]`, `[sandbox_workspace_write]`, `[agents]`,
`[features]`, `[tools]`, and `[tui]` tables. A refresh, including those
accompanying provider, scope, or model answers, changes only those keys and
keeps every other byte: your own keys (also inside AI-DLC's tables), your own
tables (such as `[agents.<role>]` or `[mcp_servers.<name>]`), comments, order,
and spelling. An AI-DLC value nobody changed takes the release's value; a value
you changed stays yours, with a note when a release ships a different one
(delete the key and refresh to take it); a deleted AI-DLC key comes back, with
a note. The active space's `AIDLC_RULES_DIR` stays as it is. A project that
already has its own `.codex/config.toml` keeps it on first install, and AI-DLC
adds its settings. A file the refresh cannot merge safely (it does not parse,
or uses one of AI-DLC's table names for something else, such as an array of
tables) still reports a conflict; `--force` then restores AI-DLC's tables while
retaining unrelated project-owned fields. An explicit `--from` selects that
source instead of the project's copy.

Human output prints `Note:` when AI-DLC entries in `.claude/settings.json` or
`.codex/config.toml` were restored or added, and when your own value for one of
them (a custom Claude statusline or announcement, or a Codex key) was kept
while this release ships a different one; JSON output exposes the same
messages in `data.notes`. To restore them, use `aidlc config --harness claude`
or `aidlc config --harness codex`, not the bare interactive setup walk.
Copy-channel projects also pass `--from <the runtime/<harness> root you copied
from>`.

`opencode.json` belongs to the team: config adds AI-DLC's entries to it and
keeps every other key, value, comment, and line. Provider answers edit only
the entries AI-DLC wrote.

### Root Integrations and Ownership

| Surface | Harnesses | Policy |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `.gitignore` | All | Own one marked AI-DLC block containing the union of installed harnesses' shipped entries; preserve every byte outside it |
| `.mcp.json` / `mcpServers` | Claude | Add or remove only consented, baseline-owned entries; preserve user keys and overrides |
| `AGENTS.md` | Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot | One marked block; harness-neutral and shared (`shared: "identical"`) except Copilot, whose block carries its `@`-imports; preserve project instructions |
| `opencode.json` | OpenCode | `json-entries`: add AI-DLC's entries (`$schema`, its `skills.paths` and `instructions` strings, its `permission` rules) only where absent, and a permission map's `"*"` rule only when the map has none, first, so the team's rules after it still decide; keep the team's model, provider, own instructions and rules, comments, and layout; record what AI-DLC wrote, follow or retire only entries still holding that value. A file AI-DLC wrote whole in an earlier release is adopted. The copy runtime leaves this file out; its setup (or the first session where setup never ran) adds AI-DLC's part |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | Copilot | `jsonc-settings`: add `chat.agent.maxRequests` (200) only when the project does not set it; never change a value someone else set, other keys, or comments; record only what AI-DLC added, and on retirement remove it only while it holds the value AI-DLC wrote; once added, a key the team takes out of a file it keeps is not added back. The copy runtime leaves this file out |

**More than one harness in a project.** Harnesses may coexist when their engine
directories differ and they do not share an exclusive managed block. `AGENTS.md`
is neutral and byte-identical (`shared: "identical"`) across Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE,
Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode, so any of those with distinct engine directories
may coexist. Codex's harness-specific onboarding is injected through
`developer_instructions` in the project `.codex/config.toml` when the project is
trusted, with `.codex/onboarding.md` as its readable copy.
Claude Code may coexist with any other harness. Copilot's `AGENTS.md`
stays exclusive: pairing it with another harness that ships that block is refused
with `cannot coexist in one project`, regardless of which is installed first.
Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE still share `.kiro/`, and OpenCode and Copilot share `.aidlc/`,
so those pairs cannot coexist. Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE can replace each other
instead: in a project that has one of them, `aidlc config --harness kiro-ide`
(or `--harness kiro`) switches `.kiro/` to the other in place. The switch is a
refresh planned from the installed row's ownership baseline: it removes the files
only that row shipped, keeps `aidlc/`, reports a locally modified file it would
replace or remove as a conflict, and, like any refresh, is done while work is open.
Switching to `kiro-ide` names every `.kiro/hooks/*.json` file AI-DLC does not
own: Kiro runs those on its v3 engine, which the switch pins in
`.kiro/settings/cli.json`, and in Kiro IDE. When there is one, the switch applies
only with your approval of that exact set of files: answer the prompt in a
terminal, or run the switch with `--dry-run`, review the files, and apply it with
the `--plan-token` that dry run prints. A hook file added, removed, renamed, or
changed after that review stops the switch, including one that appears before
the switch takes its transaction lock or while it commits its files, which rolls
the switch back. The switch refuses when `.kiro/hooks` is
a link or a file (before reading anything under it), or when a hook entry
AI-DLC does not own is a link or anything other than a regular file, rather
than follow it. It needs that baseline
(`.kiro/tools/data/aidlc-manifest.json`). Without one, refresh the installed row
with `aidlc config --harness <installed>` first; the same holds for a baseline
recorded before AI-DLC listed only the files it ships there, which a refresh
brings up to date. The switch never changes a damaged one: move it aside
yourself (the printed step names its full path), then run that refresh. A
switch that clears the trust review names the `config trust --harness <row>`
command that records it again. A release passed with `--from`
and no `--harness` never switches the row. OpenCode and Copilot are not switched
this way. For an older installed harness whose root block
is not shared, the `predates shared onboarding` error suggests refreshing it with
`aidlc config --harness <name>` first. This is a hint for an older sibling, not a
promise that refreshing enables coexistence: if it still refuses afterwards,
the sibling's block is exclusive. Copilot's block stays exclusive after refresh.
A refresh source that no longer
declares `AGENTS.md` shared is also refused while another installed harness shares
it: `refusing to refresh <harness> from a release whose AGENTS.md is not shared`.
Use a release that declares the block shared; `--force` cannot bypass this guard.
A shared `AGENTS.md` block owned by a sibling from a different release is a
conflict, not a deferred update. The error names the refresh order: refresh the
selected harness from the same release as its sibling, or refresh the sibling
from the selected release first.
Cursor's manual-copy installer is single-harness (private `AIDLC CURSOR` markers,
no `aidlc config` ownership baseline); multi-harness projects must add Cursor with
`aidlc config --harness cursor` instead.

`.gitignore` declares `shared: "union"`, so `aidlc config` writes one block combining every installed
harness's shipped entries; extra entries appear under `# <harness> harness`.
Adding a harness combines an unchanged sibling-owned block when that sibling's
shipped block copy is available (`merge (combined with <harness>)`); older
installs without that copy keep ownership until refreshed. Each harness records
the same combined block hash on its next config invocation.
Once more than one harness is present, every `aidlc config` invocation needs
`--harness <name>`, except recording or clearing a bypass on its own.

`aidlc doctor` compares the release each harness tree records in
`tools/data/aidlc-stamp.json`. When they differ it warns `Harness trees on
different releases`, names each tree's release, and gives the commands that
bring the others level. A pinned project's trees are brought to the pin, as
config refreshes every tree to it; on a copied project that is
`bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc.ts config --harness <name> --download`. Without
a pin, natively that is `aidlc config --harness <name>` for each tree not on the
engine's release. On a copied project each tree runs its own release, so the
others are refreshed from the newest tree's release, its
`aidlc-copy-runtime-<version>.tar.gz` passed with `--from`; a tree no config run has
recorded first takes one `--download` refresh at its own release. Open work
carries on through the refresh, so there is no need to wait for it to finish.

AI-DLC's `.gitignore` lines are its own entries only. Earlier releases also
put a generic template (logs, `node_modules`, `dist`, editor files) at the top
of that block; the first refresh after upgrading keeps those lines in your part
of the file, above AI-DLC's, and says so once, so nothing they ignored becomes
visible to git. A copy that config never ran in gets the same AI-DLC block, and
an `AGENTS.md` block, from the copy's own `tools/data/root-blocks/` when its
first chat starts or work is first created; config later treats a block that
is exactly what a release shipped as its own. opencode's entries in
`opencode.json` arrive from the same folder at the same moment.

Known unmarked files and JSON entries from historical shipped projections are
adopted only when their exact recorded SHA-256 signature matches. Unknown or
modified unmarked `.gitignore` content remains user-owned, including AI-DLC
comments and rules. Config preserves that
content as a prefix and appends a fresh managed block; no rename or deletion
is needed. Other modified legacy lookalikes, including ambiguous AI-DLC
content in `AGENTS.md`, remain refused. A `.gitignore` that is not valid UTF-8
also remains untouched and requires an encoding conversion before config can
merge it safely.

Inside a Git repository, config also checks whether a user-owned rule hides
committed workflow records, including during `--dry-run`. A rule such as
`aidlc/` does: config still finishes, and ends with a note naming the rule's
file, line, and hidden record paths (`memory/**`, `codekb/**`, `intents.json`,
`aidlc-state.md`, and `audit/*.md`), because new ones will not reach teammates;
files git already tracks keep being committed. The first-run setup and
`--quiet` output show the same finding. The rule is yours, so config never rewrites or
refuses it; narrow it if the hiding is not intended. This check skips when Git
is unavailable or the project is not a Git repository.

`/aidlc --doctor` repeats this check beside the uncommitted-records check.
Its **Workspace record visibility** advisory names the same rule and hidden
paths if an ignore rule is added after config succeeds. The warning does not
change doctor's exit code and is absent when no records are hidden or Git
cannot check the project.

`--force` can replace a modified, baseline-owned managed block or managed
harness file. It cannot adopt ambiguous unmarked content or overwrite a
user-owned JSON value, including the team's own entries in `opencode.json`. Malformed JSON, malformed or duplicate
markers, non-regular-file targets, and retired owned content whose integrity
cannot be proved are hard conflicts.

Every planned path receives one action:

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `create` | Add an absent framework path |
| `update` | Refresh framework-owned bytes |
| `merge` | Reconcile a managed block, JSON map, or JSON array |
| `preserve` | Keep current or project-owned bytes |
| `remove` | Remove content previously owned by the baseline and retired upstream |
| `conflict` | Refuse because ownership or integrity cannot be proved |

Successful config prints the host-specific next step:

| Harness | Next step |
|---------|-----------|
| Claude Code | Open Claude Code in this project (if it is already open in this folder, exit it and start it again) and run `/aidlc --doctor` |
| Kiro CLI | Run `kiro-cli chat`, then `/aidlc --doctor` |
| Kiro IDE | Open this project in Kiro IDE; if the Restricted Mode banner shows at the top of the window and you know what is in this folder, select Manage on it, then Trust; run `Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P, or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS), choose the aidlc agent in the chat panel's agent picker, then run `/aidlc --doctor` (in Kiro CLI, start `kiro-cli` in the project instead and run `/aidlc --doctor`) |
| Codex CLI | Run `codex` (when it asks about hooks, choose Trust all and continue), then `$aidlc --doctor` |
| OpenCode | Run `opencode`, then `/aidlc --doctor` |

## Update and Version Selection

| Command | Public options and behavior |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| `aidlc update` | Install the newest release of the machine's channel with the complete all-harness runtime, then atomically activate. Accepts `--version <version>`, `--channel <stable\|preview>`, `--from <release-dir>`, `--release-base-url <url>`, `--release-api-url <url>`, `--ca-bundle <path>`, `--offline`, and `--dry-run`. |
| `aidlc update --check` | Refresh update metadata for the channel without installing. Returns 5 when the channel has a release newer than the running one, 0 when current (a running release newer than the channel's newest is current), 3 when unavailable/offline, and 1 when checks are disabled. |
| `aidlc use <version>` | Install the exact stable or preview version when it is not retained, then make it machine-active without changing project files. |
| `aidlc config --channel [stable\|preview]` | Set the machine release channel, or print it when no value is given. |
| `aidlc config --pin <version>` | Install and validate the exact version when needed, then atomically write `.aidlc-version`, record its machine-local resolved target, and register the project pin without changing the machine-active pointer. |
| `aidlc config --unpin` | Remove `.aidlc-version`, its machine-local resolved target, and its registry entry. |
| `aidlc config ... --download` | Let any config command fetch the release the project needs when this machine lacks it: the pinned release, otherwise the one its files already have. Natively it installs and registers that release, as `--pin` does; on a copied project it downloads `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`. It verifies the checksum, and the release attestation when `gh` is installed, then finishes the command. `--release-base-url` and `--ca-bundle` choose a mirror. At a terminal config asks instead; scripts need the flag. |

Human lifecycle output states each completed fact. Update reports the
old-to-new version check, verified download, atomic switch, retained prior
version, any pruned unprotected releases, and the project-refresh courtesy.
A no-op says `You're on the latest version of aidlc (<version>).`; `--dry-run`
says `Would update aidlc from <old> to <new>.`, or
`You're on the latest version of aidlc (<version>); nothing to update.` when
nothing would change. On the preview channel the update lines say
`preview releases` and `latest preview version`. A plain `aidlc update` never
installs a release older than the one running: on a machine that follows stable
and runs a newer preview, it changes nothing and says `You're on <preview>, newer
than the latest stable <x.y.z>, so there's nothing to update.`, then how to go
back to stable (`aidlc update --channel stable`) and how to keep getting
previews (`aidlc config --channel preview`); once a newer stable ships, it moves
to it. An update onto the channel the machine follows, from a release of the
other one, adds `Switched release channel from <a> to <b>.`; one that moves onto
the other channel for one run (`--channel`, `--version` or `--from`) says that
the machine follows its channel, with the same two ways on. `aidlc use`
distinguishes `Now using` from `Already using`, and uninstall states exactly
which machine state was removed or kept. JSON and quiet messages retain their
stable machine contracts; update JSON carries `channel` and, on a switch,
`channelSwitch`.

Update downloads and fully validates a candidate before changing the active
pointer. Failed updates automatically restore the prior consistent
installation. A successful update retains the prior active version and every
registered project pin, then prunes older unprotected versions automatically.
There is no public rollback or retained-version management command.

## Release Channels

`main` is the shared development branch. The **stable** channel publishes a
selected commit as a GitHub release tagged `vX.Y.Z`. The **preview** channel
lets users try changes from `main` before the next stable release as a GitHub
prerelease that is never marked "latest". Source versions and changelog entries
are updated during release preparation.

Scheduled and manual runs share one serialized publication queue. A run skips
publication when the source is unchanged since the latest published preview, or
when a newer preview already contains it (an older run, retried or queued); its
checks and nightly tests still run, and no preview is published. When `main`
advances more than once on the same UTC date, each changed source can publish a
new preview with the next build counter.

A preview still publishes when its nightly tests fail. Its release notes then
open with a warning and end with a Full Suite failure report (failed jobs and
any failing tests), so check it before relying on a preview.

A preview id is `<x.y.(z+1)>-preview.<YYYYMMDD>.<N>`: the next patch after the
source tree's current stable version, the UTC build date chosen during
planning, and a retry counter (`1` initially). The workflow calculates the
preview version without editing the source version. Drafts and tags left by
failed attempts reserve ids. A retry or another changed source on the same date
advances `N` past those occupied ids.

Stable ids stay exactly `x.y.z`, and nothing else is accepted anywhere a
version appears (installer flags, `use`, pins, `.aidlc-version`, retained
version directories). Ids order numerically on `x.y.z`; at an equal base the
stable release sorts above every preview built from it, and previews order by
build date then counter. Inside a preview artifact `aidlc version`,
`version.json`, and doctor bundles all report the preview id; the source tree is
never modified.

```bash
aidlc config --channel preview   # follow the preview stream
aidlc update                     # newest published preview
aidlc update --check             # 5 when a newer preview exists
aidlc config --channel stable    # back to the stable stream
aidlc update --channel stable    # newest stable now, reported as a channel switch
```

The channel is machine-local: `aidlc config --channel` writes a `channel`
marker beside the update cache and `pins.json` under the install root
(`stable` when the marker is absent), `aidlc uninstall` preserves it with the
other machine settings, and `--purge` removes it. `aidlc update --channel <c>`
overrides the marker for one run; `--version` and `--from` select an exact
release regardless of channel. Stable discovery is unchanged (the
`latest/download` redirect). Preview discovery lists the releases of the
repository behind the release base URL through the GitHub API, keeps the
newest published prerelease by preview version id, and installs it through
the exact-version path. Drafts and tags without a published release are ignored.
For `github.com` base URLs the API endpoint is derived; for any other host set
`--release-api-url <url>` or `AIDLC_RELEASE_API_URL`.
An API failure, a rate limit, or a repository with no published preview is
reported as unavailable (exit 3); the client never falls back to the stable
release. The update cache records the channel it was refreshed for, so a cached
preview result never answers a stable check or the reverse.

Switching back is `aidlc config --channel stable`. A plain `aidlc update` then
waits for a stable release newer than the preview you are running; to go back
now, run `aidlc update --channel stable`, which installs the newest stable even
when its id sorts below the preview and reports a channel switch. Preview retention is a bounded window on top
of the protection every release has (active, rollback, in use, pinned): after
an update the two newest complete previews stay, and every older preview
without its own protection is pruned; stable retention is unchanged.

Version pruning also uses recorded file lists and empty-directory cleanup.
If a selected version contains unowned or changed paths, pruning is refused
and the files are kept for review.

Project pins keep overriding the machine channel: `aidlc config --pin <id>` and
`.aidlc-version` accept preview ids, and a pinned project dispatches to that
exact retained version whatever the machine follows.

Previews are `main` as it stands, including project state-schema changes. A
preview that raises the state schema writes project state a stable build does
not understand, and the code refuses to open state newer than the build; that
project cannot be walked back to stable until a stable release ships the same
schema. Use the preview channel on projects you can recreate, or pin them.

## Project Pins and CI

```bash
aidlc config --pin 2.5.45
git add .aidlc-version
```

`aidlc config --pin <version>` installs and validates the version if needed,
writes `.aidlc-version`, records the absolute binary target under the
gitignored `aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/` runtime directory, and registers the real
project path in machine-local `pins.json`.
Registry reads canonicalize filesystem aliases (including macOS `/var` and
`/private/var`) and JSON output reports the canonical project path. Equivalent
keys with the same version collapse; conflicting equivalents fail closed until
`config --pin` or `config --unpin` reconciles every alias for that project.

Commit only `.aidlc-version`. The stable `aidlc` launcher starts the
integrity-checked active binary, whose dispatcher validates the complete pinned
binary and runtime before selecting it. A missing, malformed, tampered, or
unavailable target fails closed with `aidlc config --pin <version>` remediation, and
`aidlc doctor` reports the same condition. Machine lifecycle commands use the
active binary; `doctor`, `config`, and `use` are never trapped behind a broken
pin. When a teammate commits a pin to a release this machine lacks, a config
command on the project names it, and `--download` (or a yes at the terminal)
installs and registers it as `config --pin` would, then finishes the command.
An installed pinned release is used without asking, and files behind it are
updated first.

A pin switches the engine that serves the project at once, but the project's
own files stay at the version they were last refreshed to until the next
`aidlc config`. While work is open, `config --pin` and `config --unpin` are
done as asked; when the project's files are on another version than the one it
now follows (or on a release from before versions were recorded), the reply
ends with "Run `aidlc config` to finish updating this project."

A fresh clone or CI runner installs the committed version before config:

```bash
version=$(cat .aidlc-version)
tag="v$version"
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
gh release download "$tag" --repo github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows --dir "$tmp" \
  --pattern install.sh --pattern aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl
gh attestation verify "$tmp/install.sh" \
  --bundle "$tmp/aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl" \
  --repo awslabs/aidlc-workflows \
  --signer-workflow awslabs/aidlc-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --hostname github.com \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$tag"
sh "$tmp/install.sh" --version "$version" --quiet --yes
rm -rf "$tmp"
aidlc config --pin "$version" --project-dir "$PWD" --quiet
aidlc config --project-dir "$PWD" --harness claude --mcp none --quiet
aidlc doctor --project-dir "$PWD" --quiet
```

## Harness Selection

Harness selection belongs to `aidlc config --harness <name>`. Machine-level
harness management is not a public command.

## Offline Packages

The release asset set is the offline package. It includes
`aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl` alongside the binaries, runtime, installers,
`version.json`, and `checksums.txt`. Download one complete release on a
connected machine and transfer that directory unchanged. Local installation
fails closed if the bundle is missing or does not authenticate
`checksums.txt`:

```bash
gh release download v2.5.45 --repo github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows --dir ./aidlc-offline
```

Install on the disconnected machine:

```bash
bash ./aidlc-offline/install.sh \
  --from ./aidlc-offline --offline
```

```powershell
& .\aidlc-offline\install.ps1 `
  -From .\aidlc-offline -Offline
```

For native commands, `--offline`, `AIDLC_OFFLINE=1`, or global `offline=true`
prevents release sockets. A network operation without `--from` then fails
before mutation. Config, doctor, version, and uninstall are local regardless.

## Mirrors, Proxies, CAs, and Update Settings

Release settings resolve in explicit option, environment, machine-config,
default order:

| Setting | Environment | Machine config |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Offline | `AIDLC_OFFLINE=1` (`0` explicitly enables network) | `aidlc system config global set offline on` |
| Mirror | `AIDLC_RELEASE_BASE_URL` | `aidlc system config global set release-base-url <url>` |
| Preview releases API | `AIDLC_RELEASE_API_URL` (or `aidlc update --release-api-url <url>`) | derived from the mirror for `github.com`; not a machine config key |
| CA bundle | `AIDLC_CA_BUNDLE` | `aidlc system config global set ca-bundle <absolute-path>` |

Manage the four machine keys:

```bash
aidlc system config global list
aidlc system config global get update-check
aidlc system config global set update-check off
aidlc system config global set offline on
aidlc system config global set release-base-url https://mirror.example/releases
aidlc system config global set ca-bundle /absolute/path/corporate-ca.pem
aidlc system config global clear ca-bundle
```

The keys are `update-check`, `offline`, `release-base-url`, and `ca-bundle`.
Boolean values accept `true|false`, `on|off`, `1|0`, or `yes|no`.
`aidlc config <get|set|clear|list> ... --global` is equivalent.

Mirror base URLs must use HTTPS, except loopback HTTP for local testing, and
cannot contain credentials, a query, or a fragment. The native lifecycle
client follows at most five redirects; redirected URLs may contain a query but
still cannot contain credentials or a fragment. Its errors redact URL
credentials, queries, and fragments.

The native release client honors `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` and
`NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`; proxy URLs must use HTTP or HTTPS. It does not read
`HTTP_PROXY`. The bootstrap scripts delegate proxy behavior to `curl`,
`wget`, or `Invoke-WebRequest`. On Windows, a custom CA bundle requires
`curl.exe`.

Bare help and management listings never refresh the network. They may display
a valid cached update notice. Interactive human `aidlc doctor` may refresh
stale or absent metadata within 750 ms. Non-TTY, `--json`, and `--quiet`
doctor runs are cache-only unless `--check-updates` is explicit.
`doctor --check-updates` and `update --check` use a five-minute metadata
backstop. Preview discovery and metadata downloads share the same deadline;
looking up the preview release does not restart the timeout.
Update checks accept version identifiers of at most 84 characters, and each numeric component
must be a safe integer (at most 9,007,199,254,740,991). Invalid identifiers in
release metadata or an existing cache are rejected before displaying notices.
The cache expires after 24 hours; a failed refresh or metadata older
than the installed binary in the same channel does not replace a valid cache.
A successful refresh can correct a previously cached future version: the cache
is advisory and does not establish a trusted minimum version.
`update-check=off` disables even explicit refreshes
but does not prevent an explicit `aidlc update`.
Update checks (the doctor refresh and `aidlc update --check`) download
`version.json` and `checksums.txt`, verify the manifest checksum, and neither
download nor verify `aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl`. This checks integrity against
the supplied checksums; it does not authenticate the release's origin.
Every install path (`aidlc update`, `aidlc use`, `aidlc config --pin`, and
`--from`) requires the provenance bundle and verifies checksums before
activation. When a compatible GitHub CLI is available, installation also
verifies the signed provenance and rejects a failed verification.

## Plugins

`aidlc doctor` reports installed-versus-composed plugin state. Plugin changes
are project configuration and converge through `aidlc config`; there is no
separate public plugin command.

## Output, Automation, and Exit Codes

The public commands support human, `--quiet`, and `--json` output where
declared by the route registry. `--json` emits a schema-versioned result
with `ok`, `code`, `status`, `message`, and command-specific `data` when
available. `--quiet` emits one success line or remediation line. Download
progress appears only in human mode.

The native diagnostic form is
`aidlc doctor [--project-dir <path>] [--verbose] [--json|--quiet]
[--check-updates] [--release-base-url <url>] [--ca-bundle <path>]
[--offline]`. `--export` writes a redacted diagnostic bundle, with
`--output <directory>` overriding its default project location; export output
is additional to the selected live-report mode. Human output groups Machine,
Project, and Framework integrity checks. Every section keeps warning/failure
rows visible and collapses healthy rows by default; `--verbose` expands every
check. Warnings are advisory and exit 0; any failed check exits 1.

`--no-color` and `NO_COLOR` disable ANSI output. `--project-dir <path>` selects
project context without changing the shell directory. Destructive operations
such as `uninstall` ask nothing on a TTY: they print what they remove and
keep, then do it. Without a TTY they require `--yes`. `--yes` never bypasses
ownership, integrity, active-workflow, or release-authentication refusals, with
one exception on Windows: an `aidlc` in the bin directory that AI-DLC did not
write, such as a hand-made Git Bash forwarder. `aidlc use`, `aidlc update` and
the installer ask once at a terminal whether to replace it; `--yes` answers
yes, and the file is kept beside it as `aidlc.bak-<time>`.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Operational failure |
| 2 | Usage or invalid machine configuration |
| 3 | Required network result or retained runtime unavailable |
| 4 | Integrity or ownership refusal |
| 5 | Check completed and action is required, such as an available update |

## Help and Completions

`aidlc --help` prints exactly the six public commands. Each public command also
has side-effect-free command help: `aidlc <command> --help` (or `-h`) for
`config`, `doctor`, `version`, `update`, `use`, and `uninstall`. Config-level
help names all six policy sections; `aidlc config <section> --help` keeps the
section-specific help. `aidlc help --all` reveals the hidden `engine` and
`system` namespaces and points to
`aidlc engine --help` / `aidlc system --help` for their full inventories.
The installer places Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell files under the per-user AI-DLC data root's
`completions/` directory, generated from the public route registry; there is
no public completion-generation verb.

## Transactions and Recovery

Project and machine mutations stage on the destination filesystem, validate
the candidate, and commit through rename boundaries. The filesystem remains
responsible for coherent file identity and append behavior, atomic file
replacement and directory rename, exclusive creation, and meaningful regular-file
`fsync`. AI-DLC adds no copy-and-delete fallback for rename. Concurrent changes
detected against planned state abort instead of overwriting new bytes.
Abandoned owner-private staging is swept only after lock and ownership checks.
Unsupported directory `fsync` is tolerated, so a successful command alone
cannot promise metadata durability after a crash.

Transaction locking prefers hard links and automatically falls back to an
owner-stamped directory. Both occupy `.aidlc-transaction.lock`, preserving
exclusion with live legacy file owners. A dedicated owner-stamped gate in the
local temporary directory serializes transactions and ownership changes.
This supports only cooperating processes on **one continuously running mount
on one host**, sharing the same canonical project path, local temporary
directory (`TMPDIR` on Unix), and PID namespace. It is not distributed locking
across hosts or independent mounts, even when they access the same bucket.

The first-run probe is an early capability check; directory-lock transactions
also probe before applying changes. Neither replaces validation or real lock
acquisition, and passing calls cannot prove atomic rename or crash durability.
Compatibility depends on the driver and its actual semantics:

| Storage | Compatibility boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Local ext4 or XFS, including EC2 EBS volumes | Suitable project storage for the required filesystem operations. |
| POSIX-like mount without hard links | Config and transactions can run with directory locking if all remaining requirements hold, within the single-mount scope above. |
| Mountpoint for Amazon S3 | Full workflows remain incompatible: directory rename and general mutable-file updates are unavailable. S3 Express single-file rename does not remove those limits. See [Mountpoint filesystem semantics](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/5e400f788f8cbca028f3314d84ef2df2c7fcf536/doc/SEMANTICS.md). |
| s3fs-fuse | Rename uses copy then delete and is not atomic. Passing probes does not establish support for general crash-safe AI-DLC transactions. See [s3fs limitations](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse/blob/fc5778fe83b533a9beed9383f3ce99de76207ef9/README.md#L153-L163). |

The fallback removes the transaction lock's hard-link requirement; separate
operations can still require hard links, including workspace sync when it
publishes generated files. Upstream semantics and simulated failures are not
live validation of a particular S3 mount. Use compatible local/EBS project
storage when a mount cannot meet these requirements; see [filesystem troubleshooting](15-troubleshooting.md#config-fails-with-a-hard-link-error).
For foreign or incomplete lock owners, follow [Transaction lock ownership](15-troubleshooting.md#transaction-lock-ownership)
before any manual recovery.

If rollback of an interrupted commit cannot be completed safely, evidence is
retained in a named `.aidlc-recovery-*` quarantine under the machine install
root or project root. `aidlc doctor` reports it. Recover any needed files,
ensure no AI-DLC mutation is running, then remove only the listed directory
manually. Automatic staging cleanup never deletes quarantines.

Windows uninstall uses a recoverable continuation because a running executable
cannot remove its own command shim. A later command resumes a valid pending
continuation before doing other work, unless one is still running. A worker
that stops without recording a result is resumed at most three times.

When cleanup fails, it records the step that failed and the reason, and
`aidlc doctor` reports both. A failed cleanup is never relaunched by other
commands, which keep working, but machine changes stay blocked until the
uninstall finishes. Resolve the reported problem and run `aidlc uninstall`
again (with `--purge` if the original used it):

- If nothing was removed yet, the failed plan is discarded and uninstall plans
  again from the files on disk, so a file edited after confirmation is kept.
- If removal had begun, the same plan resumes. Files edited since are kept.

The `aidlc` command itself (`aidlc.cmd`, its shim, the active-version pointers,
and the active `aidlc.exe`) is removed last, after every other file and the
User PATH entry, so a failed cleanup still leaves a command to retry it. Because
the PATH entry may already be gone, run that command by its full path, which
`aidlc doctor` prints (by default
`& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\aidlc\bin\aidlc.cmd" uninstall`). If the failure
happened while removing those last files and the command no longer runs, run
the installer again: it retries the pending cleanup first, so you may need to
run it twice.

## Copy Channel

The supported manual-copy payload is the versioned `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`
release asset. Download one exact release, extract it, and copy the complete
`runtime/<harness>/` root so the harness tree, `aidlc/` workspace shell, and
any project-root files the harness needs stay together. The copy runtime leaves
out files a team's editor owns, such as Copilot's `.vscode/settings.json`, so
copying never replaces them; the [Copilot guide](harnesses/copilot.md#vs-code-request-cap)
names the one setting to add yourself. It leaves out your `.gitignore` and
`AGENTS.md` too: AI-DLC adds its own lines to them, after everything already
there, or creates them when the project has none. opencode's `opencode.json`
is left out the same way: the copy's setup adds AI-DLC's entries to your file
and keeps everything else in it, or writes the file when there is none. Claude Code's `.mcp.json` is
left out as well, so a copy starts with no MCP servers, as `aidlc config` does
by default; to turn the shipped servers on, run
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config project --harness claude --mcp defaults --yes`. It also leaves out the team's memory
files (`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/team.md`, where Practices Discovery records
the practices you affirmed, and `project.md`, where your project rules and
learnings go) and your chosen space (`aidlc/active-space`). Copying a newer
release, or a second harness, over a project therefore keeps them. In a fresh
copy, AI-DLC creates the two memory files from its bundled copy the first time
you start work. Bun is the runtime prerequisite; the native
`aidlc` executable is not required. Markdown analysis (summary confirmation,
Plan Approval tags, and the claim-sources sensor) uses Bun's built-in
`Bun.markdown` renderer, so it needs Bun 1.3.8 or newer and follows the installed
Bun's rendering:

```bash
tag=vX.Y.Z
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
runtime_asset="aidlc-copy-runtime-${tag#v}.tar.gz"
runtime_checksum="${runtime_asset}.sha256"
source_repo="${AIDLC_RELEASE_REPOSITORY:-awslabs/aidlc-workflows}"
release_workflow="${AIDLC_RELEASE_WORKFLOW:-$source_repo/.github/workflows/release.yml}"
gh release download "$tag" --repo "github.com/$source_repo" --dir "$tmp" \
  --pattern "$runtime_asset" \
  --pattern "$runtime_checksum" \
  --pattern aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl
gh attestation verify "$tmp/$runtime_asset" \
  --bundle "$tmp/aidlc-release.intoto.jsonl" \
  --repo "$source_repo" \
  --signer-workflow "$release_workflow" \
  --hostname github.com \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$tag"
(cd "$tmp" && sha256sum -c "$runtime_checksum")
tar -xzf "$tmp/$runtime_asset" -C "$tmp"
RUNTIME_ROOT="$tmp/runtime"
cp -R "$RUNTIME_ROOT/claude/." your-project/
cd your-project && bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config --from "$RUNTIME_ROOT" --harness claude
```

The last line is the copy's own setup, run once from the extracted runtime: it
adds AI-DLC's lines to your `.gitignore` and `AGENTS.md` before the first chat
and checks the rest of the setup. Without it, AI-DLC adds them when the first
chat starts, or at the latest when you start work.

Later, a copied project fetches releases itself. When a config command needs
files the project does not have (a teammate's newer pin, a harness you add,
or restored files), it asks at a terminal, or accepts `--download` in a
script, to download that exact `aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, verify its
`.sha256` and, when `gh` is installed, its release attestation, and finish the
command. Without network access, the error's `offline:` line names the file
to fetch elsewhere and pass with `--from`.

The archive is assembled from the freshly regenerated Bun projections under
`dist/`. Its generated hooks and tools invoke the included TypeScript through
Bun. The native installers and lifecycle commands instead consume
`aidlc-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, assembled from `dist-release/`; users do
not normally download that archive directly.

The copy archive stays outside `version.json` and `checksums.txt` so existing
2.8.x native clients can continue to parse release metadata and self-update.
Its versioned `.sha256` sidecar authenticates the bytes directly, and the
release provenance covers both files.

On a copy install, the AI-DLC files in your project are code you run. Its hooks
run them through Bun, and on every harness except GitHub Copilot the settings it
ships also pre-approve the agent's calls to them; each harness guide describes
how its pre-approval behaves. Trusting the project folder therefore means
trusting those files: anyone who can change the project can change what those
hooks and pre-approved commands run.

When native executables are permitted, prefer `aidlc config`. It installs the
native runtime transactionally and records ownership for later refreshes.

Framework developers may instead clone the source, install dependencies, and
materialize ignored local outputs:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun scripts/package.ts
```

That creates the Bun-invoking `dist/<harness>/`, native `dist-release/<harness>/`,
and plugin projections locally. Neither generated root is committed. Direct
`bun .../tools/*.ts` calls remain source/development and debugging mechanisms,
not a second native lifecycle interface.

## Uninstall

```bash
aidlc uninstall
aidlc uninstall --purge --yes
```

Uninstall uses an explicit list of installer-owned files and checks their
contents before deleting them. It does not recursively remove installation or
version directories. Directories are removed only when empty; project trees,
unlisted files, changed files, and linked targets are preserved. The result
lists, once, each path it left because AI-DLC did not install it or it changed
after install.

New installations record a full per-version `installed-files.json` inventory,
whose hash is stored in `version.json`. Older installations use their verified
runtime inventory where available, plus the plugin folders their release
unpacked beside it, which carry the marker the release build wrote; other files
without ownership evidence are kept. A shell completion counts as AI-DLC's when
it is exactly what an AI-DLC release renders, so the completions an earlier
release wrote while it updated to this one are removed, and an edited one is
kept.
Without `--purge`, machine config, update cache, pin registrations, and the
default harness are also preserved. `--purge` selects those known machine
records for removal; it does not broaden deletion to unrelated files.

On Windows, both forms remove the User PATH entry recorded in the install
root's `windows-path.json`. Entries that existed before installation and
unrelated changes made afterward are preserved. An install without an
ownership record leaves User PATH alone. `-NoModifyPath` on a later installer
run preserves an earlier record, so that entry is still removed on uninstall.

At a terminal, uninstall says what it removes and keeps, then proceeds; without
a terminal it needs `--yes`. It refuses filesystem, home, shared-system, and
project roots, as well as root-owned, package-manager-owned, or
mixed-ownership commands. On Windows, a bound file list and expected checksums
are recorded before cleanup is scheduled. The worker rechecks paths and hashes,
refuses reparse points, and deletes files individually after the running command
exits; uninstall is done when the `aidlc` command is no longer found. An
interrupted continuation can resume only with its validated file plan.
Older journals without such a plan are refused and left for inspection. See
[Transactions and Recovery](#transactions-and-recovery) for how a failed
cleanup is reported and retried.
