# Getting Started

This guide takes you from installation to a verified first workflow. The native
installer includes every supported harness runtime and does not require Bun or
Node.js.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install AI-DLC

macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer adds the native `aidlc` command and every harness runtime. On
Windows, it installs for the current account, registers the bin directory in
persistent User PATH, and updates the current PowerShell process. Run it from a
normal PowerShell window; one opened with "Run as administrator" gets a warning
and a prompt, since installing as administrator is less safe. If another session cannot find `aidlc`, open a new terminal.
Use [`-NoModifyPath`](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#windows-powershell) to skip
both PATH changes and invoke the printed direct command instead. On macOS,
Linux, or WSL, apply the installer's PATH instruction if `aidlc` is not found.

If you cannot install a native executable or prefer to manage the project files
manually, install [Bun](https://bun.sh/), download
`aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` from the
[release](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest), copy
the complete `runtime/<harness>/` directory into the project, and run its own
setup once, as [Copy Channel](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#copy-channel) shows.
A copy never replaces your `.gitignore` or `AGENTS.md`; AI-DLC adds its own
lines to them. The manual-copy path does not require the native `aidlc`
command.

### 2. Configure a project

From the project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
aidlc config --harness claude
aidlc doctor
```

Replace `claude` with the harness you use:

| Harness | Config value | Open | Invoke |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `claude` | `/aidlc` |
| Kiro CLI | `kiro` | `kiro-cli chat` | `/aidlc` |
| Kiro IDE | `kiro-ide` | Open the project, then choose **aidlc** in the chat panel's agent picker | `/aidlc` |
| Codex CLI | `codex` | `codex` | `$aidlc` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | Open Cursor or run `agent` | `/aidlc` |
| opencode | `opencode` | `opencode` | `/aidlc` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI >= 1.0.74 / VS Code >= 1.130 | `copilot` | Copilot CLI or VS Code | `/aidlc` |

A bare `aidlc config` starts the interactive setup when a terminal is
available. It detects installed harnesses, provider state, runtime needs, and
trust actions before writing anything.

If you use Kiro IDE's own terminal in a project folder you have not trusted
yet, Kiro first asks whether you trust it. AI-DLC's hooks run only in a trusted
folder, and trusting lets the folder's `.kiro` hooks run commands on your
machine. So choose **Trust Folder & Continue** only for your own project or one
you have checked; otherwise choose **Cancel** and review the folder first (see
[First run](harnesses/kiro-ide.md#first-run)).

### 3. Start the first workflow

Open the configured harness in the project and describe the work:

```text
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

Codex CLI uses:

```text
$aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

AI-DLC selects a workflow profile from the request. You can also choose one:

```text
/aidlc express
/aidlc feature Add customer notifications
/aidlc bugfix Fix the login timeout
```

See [Workflow Profiles](workflow-profiles.md) for the available workflows and
[Your First Workflow](02-your-first-workflow.md) for an annotated walkthrough.

## Harness Prerequisites

Install and authenticate the host harness before opening it. The native AI-DLC
runtime itself does not require Git, Bun, or Node.js, but host requirements
still apply.

| Harness | Important first-run requirement | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Configure a supported provider; AI-DLC preserves the current selection | [Claude setup below](#aws-bedrock-setup) |
| Kiro CLI >= 2.6 | Sign in with `kiro-cli login` | [Kiro CLI](harnesses/kiro-cli.md) |
| Kiro IDE >= 1.1.70 (or Kiro CLI >= 2.24.1) | Sign in and open the configured project | [Kiro IDE](harnesses/kiro-ide.md) |
| Codex CLI >= 0.145.0 | Use a Git repository and approve project hook trust | [Codex CLI](harnesses/codex-cli.md) |
| Cursor | Sign in to the IDE or CLI | [Cursor](harnesses/cursor.md) |
| opencode >= 1.17 | Configure the session provider globally | [opencode](harnesses/opencode.md) |
| GitHub Copilot | Trust the project folder; use GitHub sign-in or BYOK | [GitHub Copilot](harnesses/copilot.md) |

## AWS Bedrock Setup

The Claude Code, Codex, and opencode distributions preserve the provider
already configured by the user. Amazon Bedrock is an explicit option.

### Provider-neutral default

AI-DLC does not select a model provider in the shipped Claude Code, Codex, or
opencode project configuration. The harness keeps the provider,
authentication, model, and context settings already configured by the user.
Balanced reviewer agents may cap reasoning effort, but they do not pin a
provider-specific model.

### Configure Bedrock (optional)

Run `aidlc config providers` and select `amazon-bedrock`, or configure Claude
Code directly:

1. Enable access to the configured Anthropic models in the Amazon Bedrock model
   catalog.
2. Provide AWS credentials through the normal SDK credential chain, for example
   `aws configure` or `aws sso login --profile <profile>`.
3. Use a region where those models are available.
4. Start `claude` and choose Amazon Bedrock at the provider prompt. You can run
   `/setup-bedrock` later to change the account or region.

Keep credentials and personal overrides out of the shared
`.claude/settings.json`. Put them in `.claude/settings.local.json` or the
standard AWS credential files.

To keep the provider already selected in Claude Code, choose `keep current`
in `aidlc config providers` (or pass `--provider current`). To record a different
Claude Code-supported provider explicitly, run `aidlc config providers
--provider other --yes`. This removes old AI-DLC-owned Bedrock overrides from
the shared project settings and leaves the manual setup step pending. Complete
that provider's authentication flow, then run `aidlc config providers
--acknowledge --yes` to mark the step done. See the
[Claude Code authentication guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication).

For IAM detail, model access, SSO, and regional troubleshooting, see
[Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock](https://community.aws/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide)
and the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## MCP Servers (optional)

Claude projects can install the shipped MCP defaults during config:

```bash
aidlc config --harness claude --mcp defaults
```

Use `--mcp none` to omit them. A copy-channel install starts without them; run
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts config project --harness claude --mcp defaults --yes` to add them.
The default set is:

| Server | Provides | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context7` | Library and SDK documentation | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` |
| `aws-mcp` | AWS API access | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-pricing` | AWS pricing queries | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-iac` | Infrastructure-as-code tools | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-serverless` | Serverless development tools | AWS credential chain |

The four AWS servers require `uvx` and use the standard AWS credential chain.

Every agent in the Claude session inherits available MCP servers. Missing
credentials make a server unavailable but do not block a workflow. Never put
secrets in the committed `.mcp.json`.

## Configuration and Trust

`aidlc config` is local-only and transactional. It writes the selected harness
runtime, creates the `aidlc/` workspace, merges managed project integrations,
and records an ownership baseline for later refreshes.

Preview any change:

```bash
aidlc config --dry-run
```

After config, complete any action named in its output:

| Harness | Typical action |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | If Claude Code is already open in this folder, exit it and start it again |
| Kiro CLI | Start `kiro-cli chat`; the project selects the AI-DLC agent |
| Kiro IDE | Open the configured project, then choose **aidlc** in the chat panel's agent picker |
| Codex CLI | Approve the hook trust prompt or apply the generated trust seed |
| Cursor | Open the configured project or run `agent` |
| opencode | Start `opencode` in the project |
| GitHub Copilot | Trust the project folder |

In Kiro IDE, the **aidlc** agent appears in the agent picker only after you
trust the folder and reload the window: if the Restricted Mode banner shows,
select **Manage** on it, then **Trust**, and run **Developer: Reload Window**
(see [First run](harnesses/kiro-ide.md#first-run)).

Run `aidlc doctor` after completing the action. It reports runtime, project,
provider, hook, trust, and workflow-state problems with a remediation command.

## Updating

`aidlc update` updates the machine runtime. It does not rewrite configured
projects. Refresh each project between workflows:

```bash
aidlc update
cd /path/to/your-project
aidlc doctor
aidlc config
```

Config preserves project-owned content, and a refresh while a workflow is open
is done and says whether that work carries on. Projects using plugins should run
`/aidlc plugin sync` after an engine refresh.

For version selection, project pins, offline installation, mirrors, custom CAs,
release authentication, automation, and uninstall, see
[Install and Lifecycle](18-install-and-lifecycle.md).

## What Config Creates

A configured project contains the harness integration plus an `aidlc/`
workspace. The first workflow creates an intent record under:

```text
aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/
```

That record contains workflow state, audit shards, questions, decisions, and
stage artifacts. Team knowledge and learned rules live at the space level so
later intents can reuse them.

See [Spaces and Intents](03-spaces-and-intents.md) for the layout and
[State and Audit](10-state-and-audit.md) for the recorded evidence.

## Troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
aidlc doctor
```

Then use [Troubleshooting](15-troubleshooting.md) for hooks, provider access,
approval gates, stale state, and diagnostics. Harness-specific setup problems
belong in the matching [harness guide](harnesses/README.md).
