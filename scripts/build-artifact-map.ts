/**
 * Derive one learner-facing description per stage artifact from the bundled
 * official-docs snapshot, and write it to
 * `packages/docs-bridge/data/artifact-map.json`.
 *
 * That file is excluded from Biome in `biome.json`: this script owns its
 * formatting, and a second formatter rewriting it would make the byte-identity
 * check in `tests/artifact-map.test.ts` unsatisfiable.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/build-artifact-map.ts [--workspace <root>] [--out <file>]
 *   bun scripts/build-artifact-map.ts --check
 *
 * Why derived rather than hand-written: `docs/reference/<locale>/04-stages/*.md`
 * already documents every artifact a stage writes, one row (or bullet) per file.
 * A second hand-maintained list would drift the moment upstream renames an
 * artifact — the same failure `16-artifact-vocabulary.md` avoids by deriving its
 * registry from `produces[]` instead of writing it down.
 *
 * The join key is the stage NUMBER (`2.7`), not the heading text: numbers are
 * identical across locales, headings are not. Which artifacts exist comes from
 * the compiled stage graph's `produces[]`, so a row the snapshot documents but
 * the stage no longer declares is dropped rather than shipped as a ghost entry.
 *
 * No network I/O: everything is read from this workspace.
