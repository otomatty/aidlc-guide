// The orchestration engine — the deterministic "what's next?" answerer that
// stands BESIDE the prose orchestrator (skills/aidlc/SKILL.md), not inside it.
// Nothing in SKILL.md calls this file yet; it is exercised only by its own
// unit tests until the differential corpus proves it emits the same directive
// sequence the prose orchestrator produces today. Framework behaviour is
// unchanged by this file's existence.
//
// The engine reads workflow state (aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md) and the compiled
// stage graph (data/stage-graph.json), then emits EXACTLY ONE typed Directive
// (JSON) to stdout. Workflow routing through `next` is read-only for every
// legacy/solo workflow. Explicit `next config set|get|list` requests execute
// their terminal config command before returning its output. Exact
// team ownership is the narrow exception: before routing it delegates a
// guarded `refresh-unit-progress` projection to aidlc-state.ts so the derived
// grid and aggregate Construction checkboxes cannot drift from audit receipts.
// Creation remains read-only: on a fresh workspace the engine NAMES the
// deterministic `intent-create` move via a print directive, and the conductor
// runs that separate tool. The directive's `kind` tells the conductor the
// single move to make next; the conductor relays human choices
// and supplies resolved facts, but the engine never originates a deviation,
// never calls AskUserQuestion (that is a Bash tool the conductor owns), and
// never spawns agents. Clean boundaries: a refused or malformed directive is a
// clear signal, not a silent miss — every emitted directive is validated
// against the frozen aidlc-directive.ts contract before it is printed.
//
// Subcommand dispatch table:
//   next   — resolve scope (state > flag > env > default), find the workflow's
//            position, refresh only the exact-team derived projection, and emit
//            one directive. Ordinary routing is otherwise read-only; `--single`
//            records its isolated audit start before dispatch. LIVE.
//   report — commit a transition after the conductor acted on a directive.
//            LIVE. A stage-aware dispatcher: it shells out to aidlc-state.ts
//            transitions so the next `next` reads fresh state. Explicit
//            `--stage` pins the acted directive, and a missing gated
//            in-progress state is recovered by opening the gate before approve.
//
// COMPOSE, don't reimplement. Every read composes an existing deterministic
// tool/library function:
//   - aidlc-graph.ts loadGraph()        — the compiled stage graph (one read,
//                                          cached); the node carries every
//                                          routing field the run-stage
//                                          directive needs.
//   - aidlc-lib.ts   nextInScopeStage() — the next EXECUTE stage after a slug
//                                          for a scope (state-override aware).
//   - aidlc-lib.ts   firstInScopeStageOfPhase() — first EXECUTE stage of a
//                                          phase (for the --phase resolution).
//   - aidlc-lib.ts   validScopes()      — the canonical scope-name set, derived
//                                          from scope-mapping.json.
//   - aidlc-lib.ts   getField/parseCheckboxes — state-field + checkbox reads.
//   - aidlc-lib.ts   resolveProjectDir/readStateFile — project-dir + state I/O.
//
// The non-happy-path branches (jump, resume, init, scope/config-change,
// env-scope validation) COMPOSE the sibling CLI tools by SHELLING OUT — none of
// those handlers is an importable symbol (aidlc-jump.ts and aidlc-utility.ts
// both export zero CLI handlers; they are reachable only by argv dispatch). The
// engine spawns the subcommand with Bun.spawnSync, inspects its exitCode, and
// captures its stderr VERBATIM so the user-facing error wording (e.g. the
// canonical `Invalid AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE "...". Valid scopes: ...`) is
// relayed unchanged rather than reconstructed — reconstruction would drift from
// the tool the rest of the framework asserts on. The one read-only invariant
// workflow routing keeps: it never spawns a subcommand that MUTATES. Explicit
// typed config requests are terminal commands, not workflow routing. The jump
// (resolve) and env-scope (resolve-env-scope) subcommands are pure reads; the
// init guard is spawned ONLY on the already-state-exists path, where the tool
// dies at its guard before any scaffold write.
//
// The things the engine ADDS — not composes — are (1) the decision rule that
// maps (observed state + graph) -> directive kind, and (2) the artifact-path
// resolver that turns the graph node's vocabulary NAMES into canonical
// aidlc-docs/... paths and drops conditional_on consumes-entries against the
// workflow's project type. The primitives above expose the facts; no existing
// query answers "what directive applies here?" and no graph function maps a
// vocabulary name to a path. Both are pure deterministic code — the right home
// per the tool/agent/human split (routing string-building to an LLM would
// invert the whole thesis).

// Resolve the determined boolean gate for the skeleton-gate stage once the

//
// The faithful answer (SKILL.md:655-720 — the per-Bolt steps + the walking-
// skeleton section) is that the FIRST construction stage gates in every stance.
// Both skeleton-on AND skeleton-off present a gate at Bolt 1: skeleton-on forces
// an always-gate "regardless of Construction Autonomy Mode" (SKILL.md Step 5 /
// "When skeleton-on" §1); skeleton-off runs Bolt 1 "as a regular Bolt with the
// standard batch-gate path". NOTE the NODE gate this function resolves is not
// the Bolt-level gate: this one is the stage approval gate for the skeleton-gate
// stage (the first in-scope Construction EXECUTE stage — a design stage such as
// functional-design in scopes that run one, code-generation in scopes that do
// not), and it stays `true` in every stance so that stage is always reviewed.
// The autonomy-governed gates are the REMAINING Construction stage gates, and
// the human can now grant autonomy ON DEMAND at any point in Construction (see
// aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md § Autonomy grant), so an
// `autonomous` grant can predate the first of them. The earlier rationale here —
// that autonomy "cannot be true before Bolt 1 ships" — no longer holds and must
// not be relied on. The stance changes the CEREMONY (solo + always-gate +
// ladder prompt vs regular Bolt + batch gate) — orchestration the conductor
// runs — not whether a gate is presented at Bolt 1. The gate axis is on for all
// construction work (only bootstrap init stages auto-proceed; gate-axis ≠
// execution-axis). So the resolved value is `true` for every stance.
//
// Why the round-trip still earns its keep: the engine cannot EMIT a boolean it
// has not determined. Classifying the prose is what rules out a stance that
// WOULD change Bolt-1 routing; only after the conductor hands back a typed
// stance can the engine commit the determined gate. The value being true in
// every branch is the correct outcome, not a no-op — the determinism is in
// having classified, not in the boolean differing per stance. `scope` and the
// scope-default set are threaded through so the resolution reads against the
// SKILL.md rules verbatim and a future scope/ceremony change resolves here, in

//   - the human granted autonomy at the walking-skeleton ladder
//     (Construction Autonomy Mode: autonomous);
//   - the compiled Bolt/unit DAG yields a non-empty batch.
// The swarm advances ONE Bolt BATCH per `next`: it walks the batches in
// topological order and selects the FIRST batch that still has an unconverged
// unit, emitting `{kind:"invoke-swarm", units: <that batch's unconverged units>}`
// so a batch with a partial pass (some units baton-returned) re-fans only the
// units still owed. Earlier batches are never re-emitted once every one of their
// units has converged, so the run climbs the DAG batch by batch instead of
// re-emitting batch 1 forever. The completion signal is the audit ledger
// (swarmConvergedUnits, the `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` rows the referee writes back
// to the main checkout), NOT artifact presence: a swarm unit's produced files
// stay in its Bolt worktree, so the inline per-unit disk-coverage ledger never
// sees them (that is why this path owns its own signal).
//
// When EVERY unit in EVERY batch has converged, the stage is built: the engine
// emits the stage's settle directive (a run-stage for the last unit carrying the
// stage's computed gate, the SAME shape emitPerUnitRunStage's all-covered
// re-entry produces) so the conductor completes the stage and the workflow moves
// on, and returns true. It does NOT return false there: the caller's fallback
// (emitPerUnitRunStage) keys on disk coverage the swarm never lands in the main
// tree, so it would wrongly re-run unit one inline instead of settling.
//
// On any trigger miss it returns false and emits nothing, so the caller falls
// back to the normal run-stage emit (which keeps its computed gate, including the
// skeleton round-trip sentinel). The skeleton Bolt 1 is protected STRUCTURALLY:
// the isSkeletonGateStage guard below refuses to swarm the walking-skeleton gate
// stage regardless of autonomy state. That structural guard is now the only
// protection, and it is sufficient: it matters for scopes where the per-unit
// build stage (code-generation) IS the skeleton-gate stage (poc / bugfix /
// security-patch), where the skeleton's always-gated approval must never be
// bypassed by a stray autonomous setting, so the engine enforces it rather than
// trusting the conductor's ordering.
//
// It used to ALSO be protected temporally ("autonomy stays unset until the
// ladder fires after Bolt 1 ships"). That premise no longer holds: the human can
// grant autonomy on demand at any point in Construction, so an autonomous grant
// can predate the first Unit-building stage by design (see
// aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md § Autonomy grant).
// Scopes whose first Construction EXECUTE stage is a design stage therefore DO
// swarm code-generation from the first Unit; scopes where code-generation is
// itself the skeleton-gate stage still cannot, via the structural guard.

// covers. Ledgers are read per block stage (each stage keeps its own receipt
// set); the paused-unit hard stop mirrors emitPerUnitRunStage: a pause on ANY
// block stage halts the walk before new (stage, unit) work. Read-only, so
// routing (emitUnitMajorRunStage) and the skip report (unitMajorWorkBeat)
// share one walk and cannot disagree about which beat is active.
//
// The person can ask for another Unit's work while one is open (#1411): the
// open Unit is then paused, set aside for that Unit. Such a pause does not halt
// the walk while the Unit it was set aside for still has work; the walk takes
// that Unit, then stops at the set-aside Unit to pick it up again. A Unit in
// progress goes before the others, so a Unit picked up again comes first.

// jump path emits a `print` naming `aidlc-jump.ts execute`. The conductor runs
// that mutating tool, then re-runs `next`; the next `next` reads the pivoted
// state and naturally emits the run-stage for the now-current target. This
// composes the existing CLI-only `execute` handler (no new directive field, no
// jump vocabulary in `report`, and `next` stays read-only).
//
// The conductor RELAYS the human's jump target; the engine SUPPLIES the
// resolved facts. It shells out to `aidlc-jump.ts resolve` (a pure read) —
// that handler both checks the target against the plan (a --stage target the
// plan skips comes back marked `target_skipped`, a --phase with no planned
// stage is refused) AND computes the forward/backward/redo direction at
// aidlc-jump.ts:142-145. We relay a rejection verbatim and, on success, compose
// the `execute` command with the tool's own `target_slug` + `direction`.
// Re-deriving the SKILL.md:191-193 comparison by hand would be an LLM-shaped
// move; delegating it to the tool is the deterministic one.
//
// resolve REQUIRES a state file (it reads `Current Stage` to anchor the
// direction). With no workflow yet, there is no position to jump FROM — the
// direction is undefined, and there are no intervening stages to skip or reset,
// so a jump is really just "start here". That NO-STATE path falls back to a
// direct graph lookup that names the requested target (the prose's "or 0.3 if
// freshly initialized" degenerate case) and emits a plain run-stage — it is NOT
// a commit, so it does not route through `execute`.
// SKILL.md step 5 (Initialization guard) verbatim: jumping to an initialization
// stage — or `--phase initialization` — is rejected. Init stages have bootstrap
// behavior (create the state file, scaffold dirs) that doesn't fit the jump
// model; the user must run `/aidlc --init`. The guard is prose-only in SKILL.md

// transition subcommands and reimplements none of their transition logic.
// Those subcommands are CLI-only (aidlc-state.ts
// exports nothing); importing a handle* function is a hard build failure, so
// the only seam is the argv dispatch — Bun.spawnSync the subcommand.
//
// Why no withAuditLock here: each spawned aidlc-state.ts subcommand is already
// atomic — it does its own per-emit OS mkdir-lock acquire/release in its own
// process. The engine's withAuditLock would NOT span that subprocess (the lock
// is per-process), so wrapping the spawn in one buys nothing. The engine holds
// a lock only if it emits its OWN in-process audit row, which report does not —
// it delegates every emission to the already-atomic subcommand.
//
// The dispatch choice is the engine's small ADDED decision rule (mirroring the
// `next` decision rule): map the acted stage to its committing subcommand by
// GATE STATUS first, then finality.
//   - gated stage   -> `approve`. approve OWNS the full transition: it emits
//                      GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED and then self-delegates
//                      in-process to advance (non-final) or complete-workflow

//                      call advance after approve"). Branching on finality here
//                      would double-dispatch a final gated stage. When an
//                      explicit --stage report finds the stage still active,
//                      report first opens the missing gate, then approves.
//   - non-gated, not the final in-scope stage -> `advance`.
//   - non-gated, final in-scope stage          -> `complete-workflow`.
// Gate status is the same axis `next` uses to build a run-stage directive: only
// the bootstrap initialization stages auto-proceed with no gate; every other
// EXECUTE stage gates. Finality is "no in-scope stage remains after this one".

// The outcomes `report --result` accepts. A forward commit reports that the
// stage the conductor just worked on succeeded; `approved` and `completed` are
// accepted synonyms for that verdict (the conductor naturally says "approved"

//
//   A `--single` run NEVER touches the main state file's `Current Stage`.
//
// It is tool-enforced two ways. (1) STRUCTURAL: this path shells out ONLY to
// `aidlc-audit.ts append-batch` (which has no state write) — never to aidlc-state.ts
// advance / approve / complete-workflow, the only subcommands that pivot the main
// pointer. So a single-stage run is mechanically incapable of advancing the main
// workflow. (2) EXPLICIT: `--single` REQUIRES a `--stage <slug>` naming the stage
// that was run. A `report --single` with NO `--stage` is exactly an attempt to
// "advance the main workflow" (commit against whatever `Current Stage` points at)
// — and that returns an `error` directive rather than silently mutating. The two
// together make "advance the main workflow from a single run" unreachable.
//
// STAGE_COMPLETED carries Stage + Details + Workflow, matching the field shape
// aidlc-state.ts emits. A direct report without an open synthetic start is
// rejected, so pipeline receipts always have an authoritative attempt floor.
//
// The reviewer precondition is DELIBERATELY not engine-enforced here. It
// guards the four completing state transitions (aidlc-state.ts approve /
// advance / finalize / complete-workflow), none of which this path reaches —
// structurally, per invariant (1) above. An isolated run has no gate to
// protect; its reviewer step is prose-driven (SKILL.md single-runner branch),
// and its receipts are tagged `single-stage:<slug>` precisely so they can
// never satisfy the MAIN workflow's guard.
