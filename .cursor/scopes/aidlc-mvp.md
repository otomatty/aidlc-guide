# mvp scope

Standard depth, but trims the front and back of the workflow to ship the
core fast. Ideation runs a reduced ceremony (no market-research, no
team-formation, no approval-handoff) and the entire operation phase is
skipped — an MVP proves the product, it does not yet carry production
operations weight.

Guard Policy defaults to off: changed inputs are recorded and announced, the run continues, and plan approval, review freeze, state transition, and reviewer read scope are lowered for undirected work. Human presence stays up.

## Why these stages, why skip those

The full inception and construction passes stay EXECUTE: an MVP is still
real software that needs design, code, and tests. What it skips is the
discovery overhead that only pays off at scale (market-research,
team-formation) and the operation stages (deployment-pipeline,
environment-provisioning, deployment-execution, observability-setup,
incident-response, performance-validation, feedback-optimization), which
belong to a product past its first proof. Promote to `feature` or
`enterprise` when the MVP graduates.

## Membership

Keyword triggers: `mvp`, `minimum viable`. Initialization, the reduced
ideation set, all of inception, and the build path of construction run;
operation is skipped wholesale.
